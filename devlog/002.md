## I Dun Goofed

Because I'm still an OpenGL scrub, I didn't realize that I needed another library to load OpenGL functions for me. Therefore, I sat at my desk trying to figure out why my code won't compile for half an hour, thinking that maybe JUST MAYBE I made a small spelling mistake. Needless to say, I realized my mistake and now the project also uses GLEW to load openGL functions and extensions. My new build.bat file looks like this:
```
@echo off
pushd ..\build
cl ..\src\main.cpp opengl32.lib /I C:\Users\ianw3214\workspace\HeavensEdge\libs\glfw-3.2.1.bin.WIN32\include /I C:\Users\ianw3214\workspace\HeavensEdge\libs\glew-2.0.0\include\GL /link C:\Users\ianw3214\workspace\HeavensEdge\libs\glfw-3.2.1.bin.WIN32\lib-vc2015\glfw3.lib C:\Users\ianw3214\workspace\HeavensEdge\libs\glfw-3.2.1.bin.WIN32\lib-vc2015\glfw3dll.lib  C:\Users\ianw3214\workspace\HeavensEdge\libs\glew-2.0.0\lib\Release\Win32\glew32.lib C:\Users\ianw3214\workspace\HeavensEdge\libs\glew-2.0.0\lib\Release\Win32\glew32s.lib /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE
popd
echo on
```

Now that everything's linked nice and happy, troubles starting to brew in my code... First I didn't realize I had to initialize GLEW before using it, so that took me quite a while to figure out. Then, the initialization wasn't working, so I needed to figure that out too. Apparently, you need to get the context of OpenGL before initializing GLEW, which is really confusing.. As it turns out, I was missing this piece of code...
```c++
glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);
```

## OpenGL Objects

Objects in openGL have unique IDs corresponding to them with the type **GLuint**.
```c++
GLuint VBO;
// create an OpenGL buffer
glGenBuffers(1, &VBO);
```
In the above example, we first initialize a GLuint to hold our object ID. Then, we call the GenBuffers function that takes 2 parameters, the first being an int to declare how many objects to generate and the second being a reference to the previous GLuint variable to store the resulting object IDs.

### Buffers

In order to render something to the screen, we need to create a vertex buffer object, which essentially stores a large amount of vertices in the GPU's memory. The buffer type of a vertex buffer object is **GL_ARRAY_BUFFER**, so we will bind that to our previously created buffer. Note that OpenGL allows us to bind several buffers at once as long as they have a different buffer type.
```c++
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, VBO);
```
From this point on, any calls made to the *GL_ARRAY_BUFFER* target will be used to configure the currently bound buffer, VBO. The **glBufferData** function copies previously defined vertex data into the buffer's memory.
```c++
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertices), ertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
```
The fourth parameter of the function specifies how we want the graphics card to manage the data. there are 3 possible inputs:
  - **GL_STATIC_DRAW**: the data will most likely not change at all or very rarely
  - **GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW**: the data is likely to change a lot
  - **GL_STREAM_DRAW**: the data will change every time it is drawn

Since we are not changing the position of our input triangle, so *GL_STATIC_DRAW* is the best option in this case.

## Shaders

Shaders are confusing as hell so I'll just leave [this tutorial here.](https://learnopengl.com/#!Getting-started/Hello-Triangle)

I'm not sure exactly how everything works yet, but from my understanding, rendering starts with writing shaders. Shaders can fall into two types, vertex and fragment shaders. The vertex shaders handle the vertices, and the fragment shaders handle texturing the pixels in between. The shader code is compiled from within the main program itself, and looks something like this:

```c++
// Source code for the vertex shader
std::string shaderStuff = "#version 330 core\nlayout (location = 0) in vec3 position;\n"
"void main()\n{\ngl_Position = vec4(position.x, position.y, position.z, 1.0);\n}\0";
const GLchar* vertexShaderSource = shaderStuff.c_str();

// Source code for the fragment shader
// set the color to blue with full opacity
std::string shaderStuff2 = "#version 330 core\nout vec4 color;\nvoid main()\n"
"{\ncolor = vec4(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);\n}\n\0";
const GLchar* fragmentShaderSource = shaderStuff2.c_str();
```
I have no idea how shader code works right now, so that is something for me to look into in the future. After writing the shader code, we then have to compile it into a program before we can use it. That step looks something like this:
```c++
// compile the vertex shader
GLuint vertexShader = glCreateShader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER);
glShaderSource(vertexShader, 1, &vertexShaderSource, NULL);
glCompileShader(vertexShader);

// compile the fragment shader
GLuint fragmentShader = glCreateShader(GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER);
glShaderSource(fragmentShader, 1, &fragmentShaderSource, NULL);
glCompileShader(fragmentShader);

// Link shaders to a shader program
GLuint shaderProgram = glCreateProgram();
glAttachShader(shaderProgram, vertexShader);
glAttachShader(shaderProgram, fragmentShader);
glLinkProgram(shaderProgram);
```
After that, we set up a vertex buffer object and a vertex array object, which will look something like this:
```c++
// Set up vertex data for the triangle to render
GLfloat vertices[] = {
    -1.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f, // Left
     1.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f, // Right
     0.0f,  1.0f, 0.0f  // Top
};
// set up the Vertex buffer object and vertex array object
GLuint VBO, VAO;
glGenVertexArrays(1, &VAO);
glGenBuffers(1, &VBO);

// Bind the Vertex Array Object
glBindVertexArray(VAO);

// Bind and set vertex buffer(s)
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, VBO);
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertices), vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);

// the vertex attribute pointer tells opengl how to interpret the vertex data it recieves
glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 3 * sizeof(GLfloat), (GLvoid*)0);
glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);

// Unbind VAO
glBindVertexArray(0);
```
Finally, to render to the screen, we add this magical piece of code:
```c++
// Clear the colorbuffer
glClearColor(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

// Draw the triangle with the shader program
glUseProgram(shaderProgram);
glBindVertexArray(VAO);
glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 3);
glBindVertexArray(0);
```
Somehow, all of this works... Since I didn't quite understand what exactly I did today and just followed a tutorial, I will have to look more in depth into the whole rendering process again in the future and redo this whole step. :'(

## Notes:

```c++
glClearColor(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
```
A state setting function that sets the color that will be used when clearing the screen. The example above sets the clearing color to black.

```c++
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
```
The function that actually clears the screen, does not set OpenGL state. The **GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT** parameter means that the clear call will affect the color buffer, causing it to be cleared to the set clearing color.
