## Basic menu

To start with, I implemented a bare bones menu. In fact, it is so basic that it isn't even a menu, it is more of a transition state. I just put it in first so that I know the state transitions work. All it does right now is show a black screen and go to the level when the player presses the space bar. Let's see how I made this magical thing! First of all, I added 2 files, *menu.cc* and *menu.h*. For now, the menu class doesn't even inherit all the base functions yet, I only have the *handleEvents* function implemented to detect a key press.
```c++
// menu.h
class Menu : public State{
public:
	Menu();
	~Menu() {};
	void handleEvents(SDL_Event);
private:
	void handleKeyPress(SDL_Keycode);
};
```
And the implementation in the source file is quite trivial as well:
```c++
// menu.cc
Menu::Menu() {
}
void Menu::handleEvents(SDL_Event event) {
	if (event.type == SDL_KEYDOWN) {
		handleKeyPress(event.key.keysym.sym);
	}
}
void Menu::handleKeyPress(SDL_Keycode key) {
	if (key == SDLK_SPACE) {
		// go to the level
		nextState = new Level("levels/test.txt");
		quit = true;
	}
}
```
After putting these two files into the project, all I had to do was change *main.cpp* to run a Menu instead of a Level and voila! Super bare bones menu.

## Menu Select Function

What's a menu without the ability to select different options? Let's *'add'* some options then. To do this, I am using a linked list that holds data about the menu item and pointers to the next and previous menu items. Unlike a normal linked list, my initial pointer doesn't go to the first node in the list and instead it points to whatever node is currently selected by the player. By doing so, I make sure I only have 1 item selected and that the item is always valid by putting *nullptr* checks. If the user presses a key, I simply navigate to the next/previous pointer and if it doesn't exist then the menuItem doesn't change. To implement this, I first make a struct representing the menu Nodes in the linked list.

```c++
struct menuItem{
	menuItem * previous;
	menuItem * next;
	int ID;
	menuItem(menuItem* a, menuItem* b, int c) : previous(a), next(b), ID(c) {};
};
```
Then, I initialize some testing menuItems in the constructor of the menu.
```c++
// initialize a test menu
currentMenuItem = new menuItem(nullptr, nullptr, 1);
menuItem * item2 = new menuItem(currentMenuItem, nullptr, 2);
menuItem * item3 = new menuItem(item2, nullptr, 3);
item2->next = item3;
currentMenuItem->next = item2;
```
Now, when the player presses the arrow keys, the linked list will navigate to the corresponding menu Item. I also added a **select** function that is triggered when the user presses the select key, and it updates the menu depending on what the current node is pointing to. Right now, the game continues if the node is the first item and does nothing otherwise.
```c++
// the select function
void Menu::select() {
	if (currentMenuItem->ID == 1) {
		nextState = new Level("levels/test.txt");
		quit = true;
	}
}
```

## New Collision Mechanics

So the old way of doing things always bugged me. Although I managed to get the auto adjusting margin thing to work, it wasn't very efficient and felt quite weird. Even though I put a lot of time into it, I still feel like it should be scrapped for a better soltion, so that's what I did. So the new collision system works off a **Shape** base class, well it's a struct but what's the difference anyways.. Anyways, the way it works is that there will be different types of shapes that inherit the **shape** base class and there will be a central collision detection function to check for collisions between all the shapes. Each different type of collision will have to be handled differently, but the logic of that will be left up to the collision class. Anyways, here is what the structs look like:
```c++
struct Shape {
	int x, y;
	SHAPE_TYPE type;
	Shape() {}
	Shape(SHAPE_TYPE t) : type(t) {}
	Shape(int _x, int _y) : x(_x), y(_y) {}
	Shape(int _x, int _y, SHAPE_TYPE t) : type(t), x(_x), y(_y) {}
};

struct Rectangle : Shape {
	int w, h;
	Rectangle() : Shape(RECT) {}
	Rectangle(int _x, int _y) : Shape(_x, _y, RECT) {}
	Rectangle(int _x, int _y, int _w, int _h) : Shape(_x, _y, RECT), w(_w), h(_h) {}
};_
```
The *SHAPE_TYPE* data type is just an enumeration to make it easier to tell what type a shape is, for example a *RECT* would represent a rectangle or *CIRC* to represent a square etc.  
After these definitions come the methods themselves. There is a central method to take general shapes and on top of that I created a method to compare rectangles for now. In the future, it can be expanded to different types of shapes for a lot more variety.
```c++
bool isColliding(Shape& shape1, Shape& shape2) {
	if (shape1.type == RECT && shape2.type == RECT) {
		Rectangle& shape1rect = static_cast<Rectangle&>(shape1);
		Rectangle& shape2rect = static_cast<Rectangle&>(shape2);
		return collisionRectRect(shape1rect, shape2rect);
	}
	// temporarily return false for any other case.
	return false;
}

bool collisionRectRect(Rectangle& rect1, Rectangle& rect2) {
	if (rect1.x < rect2.x + rect2.w && rect1.x + rect1.w > rect2.x &&
		rect1.y < rect2.y + rect2.h && rect1.h + rect1.y > rect2.y) {
		// Collision detected
		return true;
	}
	return false;
}
```
None of this has been implemented in the main code yet so that will be something to look out for. It should be very simple though, any part of the code that has a collision box would just be changed to use a shape instead and anytime I have to check for collisions I can just call the central collision check function.

## Using the new collision system

So now that the collision system has been set up, it's time to actually implement it in the code. So far, I have 2 places that use the collision system. The first is the player attack method and the second is in the move method. Before we start using the new *Shapes* for collision detection, we have to actually put the shapes somewhere. I put a *Shape* pointer called **collisionBox** in the Creature class so that every creature can compare collision boxes. The reason I made it a pointer is to avoid slicing, so if I store a *Rect* in a *Shape* variable it will retain the properties of the Rectangle. Adding this is quite trivial so I will skip that. Then, in the methods, I just replace wherever the huge chunk of code comparing positions and what not before to use the new collision methods.
```c++
// the new attack method
void Hero::key1Attack() {
	// loop through all entities and deal damage if enemy type
	if (!entityList) { return; }
	for (unsigned int i = 0; i < entityList->size(); i++) {
		if (entityList->at(i)->getType() == 2) {
			std::cout << "FLAG" << std::endl;
			// cast the type to an entity to access it's functions
			Creature * temp = dynamic_cast<Creature*>(entityList->at(i));
			// check for collisions
			if (isColliding(*collisionBox, *temp->getCollisionBox())) {
				temp->takeDamage(5);
			}
		}
	}
}*
```
The same thing was done in the *checkCollision* method, which is a helper function for the *move* method. However, because of the way movement collision was implemented, we have to construct a new shape for each tile we check against. We do this every loop, every time we need to check for a collision. Although it is not too cost-heavy, it is still a very inefficient way of doing things and I will definitely have to change it in the future.

## Changing animations

Previously, the animation system worked so that the hero would be able to face all 4 directions both idle and moving. After starting work on some of the art, I found it really difficult to draw all 4 directions of the character, so I decided to use only two directions instead. This meant that some of the movement code had to be changed, since the movement animations were so closely tied to the movement code itself. You can see the actual changes made in the code [here](https://github.com/ianw3214/HeavensEdge/commit/414bc16bfb00f1d9ab117a5c5c9f063c21d8be41)

***

On top of changing the movement animations, I also added in the attack animations for the player. This was a bit more challenging because the animations only play once, so I had to change some of the structure for how the animatedSprite class worked. What I ended up doing was adding a *nextAnimation* attribute to the AnimatedSprite class so that when the current animation finished playing, there would be a default animation it could go to. Basically, I just added an integer called nextAnim which represented the animation that would play after the current once finished. Here is what it looks like in the code:
```c++
void AnimatedSprite::update(float delta){
	Sprite::update(delta);
    deltaTime += delta;
    // TODO: customize update frame rate
    // Updates the animation frame if desired time has passed
    if(deltaTime >= 0.03f){
        currentFrame++;
        // resets animation if end is reached
        if(currentFrame >= animData.at(currentAnim)){
            // remove the animation if it should only be played once
			if (playOnce) {	REMOVE = true; }
            currentFrame = 0;
			// reset the animation to the queued animation if specified
			if (nextAnim >= 0) {
				currentAnim = nextAnim;
				nextAnim = -1;
			}
        }
        // reset the delta time once frame has been incremented
        deltaTime = 0.0f;
        // update the blitting rect of the sprite sheet to match animation frame
        updateBlitRect();
    }
}
```
As you can see, nothing has really changed. I just added an if block to the end of the update function to see what the next animation should be. By default, nextAnim is -1 so as long as nextAnim is less than 0 nothing will happen in the code block. Of course, I also added a setter function for nextAnim so that other classes had access to what animations the sprite should play next. Here is an example of how I used it in the player class:
```c++
if (faceRight) {
	hero->key1Attack(1);
	currentAnimation = ATTACK1RIGHT;
	hero->setNextAnimation(IDLE_RIGHT);
}
else {
	hero->key1Attack(0);
	currentAnimation = ATTACK1LEFT;
	hero->setNextAnimation(IDLE_LEFT);
}
```
Note that hero itself is not an AnimatedSprite class. The setNextAnimation function simply calls the SetNextAnimation function of the sprite that the hero class contains.

## Attack effects / attack directions

After implementing a basic attack animation, I decided I needed some effects to spruce things up and make it look better. All I did to implement an effect system is add a vector of sprites to the hero class and have the hero class update these sprites along with it's update/render function. Because of how sprites are implemented, I can simply make the *playOnce* property of the sprites true and they'll dissapear after they have played once through. Here's the new hero update function:
```c++
void Hero::update(float delta){
    sprite->update(delta);
	// set the position of the sprite to match that of the hero
	sprite->setPos(x, y);
	// update the collision shape as well
	collisionBox->x = x;
	collisionBox->y = y;
	// delete effects accordingly
	for (int i = effects.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
		effects.at(i)->update(delta);
		if (effects.at(i)->getRemove()) {
			AnimatedSprite* effect = effects.at(i);
			effects.erase(effects.begin() + i);
			delete effect;
		}
	}
}
```
And here is how I added a new effect to the hero in the *attack* function:
```c++
AnimatedSprite* effect = new AnimatedSprite("assets/attack.png", 100, 64, 10, true);
effect->setAnimationData({ 10 , 10});
if (direction == 1) {
	effect->setPos(getX(), getY());
	effect->playAnimation(0);
} else {
	effect->setPos(getX()-36, getY());
	effect->playAnimation(1);
}
effects.push_back(effect);
```
Note that I also changed the attack function for the hero to take an input of an integer, which represents the direction the hero attacks in. This was important because the attack collision is no longer just a square centered on the hero, which means that left and right attacks would result in different hit boxes. The resulting attack function looks like this:
```c++
void Hero::key1Attack(int direction) {
	Rectangle attackCollision(getX(), getY(), 100, 64);
	if (direction == 0) {
		attackCollision.x -= 64;
	}
	// loop through all entities and deal damage if enemy type
	if (!entityList) { return; }
	for (unsigned int i = 0; i < entityList->size(); i++) {
		if (entityList->at(i)->getType() == 2) {
			// cast the type to an entity to access it's functions
			Creature * temp = dynamic_cast<Creature*>(entityList->at(i));
			// check for collisions
			if (isColliding(attackCollision, *temp->getCollisionBox())) {
				temp->takeDamage(5);
			}
		}
	}
	... Effect animation code...
}
```

## Thoughts, Plans, the Future and Chili

Development has been going slow since my finals and summer plans, but I'm going to have to start picking up the pace again. I have a lot of the basic engine work done now, so I can start working on different features as well as making the game itself look a bit nicer. Next week, I plan on adding different attacks as well as setting up a basic enemy with a test level. Ideally, by the end of next week, I will have a working prototype that is somewhat fun to play. On the bright side, I've been starting to get some art done and it's actually looking pretty good!
