## Basic menu

To start with, I implemented a bare bones menu. In fact, it is so basic that it isn't even a menu, it is more of a transition state. I just put it in first so that I know the state transitions work. All it does right now is show a black screen and go to the level when the player presses the space bar. Let's see how I made this magical thing! First of all, I added 2 files, *menu.cc* and *menu.h*. For now, the menu class doesn't even inherit all the base functions yet, I only have the *handleEvents* function implemented to detect a key press.
```c++
// menu.h
class Menu : public State{
public:
	Menu();
	~Menu() {};
	void handleEvents(SDL_Event);
private:
	void handleKeyPress(SDL_Keycode);
};
```
And the implementation in the source file is quite trivial as well:
```c++
// menu.cc
Menu::Menu() {
}
void Menu::handleEvents(SDL_Event event) {
	if (event.type == SDL_KEYDOWN) {
		handleKeyPress(event.key.keysym.sym);
	}
}
void Menu::handleKeyPress(SDL_Keycode key) {
	if (key == SDLK_SPACE) {
		// go to the level
		nextState = new Level("levels/test.txt");
		quit = true;
	}
}
```
After putting these two files into the project, all I had to do was change *main.cpp* to run a Menu instead of a Level and voila! Super bare bones menu.

## Menu Select Function

What's a menu without the ability to select different options? Let's *'add'* some options then. To do this, I am using a linked list that holds data about the menu item and pointers to the next and previous menu items. Unlike a normal linked list, my initial pointer doesn't go to the first node in the list and instead it points to whatever node is currently selected by the player. By doing so, I make sure I only have 1 item selected and that the item is always valid by putting *nullptr* checks. If the user presses a key, I simply navigate to the next/previous pointer and if it doesn't exist then the menuItem doesn't change. To implement this, I first make a struct representing the menu Nodes in the linked list.

```c++
struct menuItem{
	menuItem * previous;
	menuItem * next;
	int ID;
	menuItem(menuItem* a, menuItem* b, int c) : previous(a), next(b), ID(c) {};
};
```
Then, I initialize some testing menuItems in the constructor of the menu.
```c++
// initialize a test menu
currentMenuItem = new menuItem(nullptr, nullptr, 1);
menuItem * item2 = new menuItem(currentMenuItem, nullptr, 2);
menuItem * item3 = new menuItem(item2, nullptr, 3);
item2->next = item3;
currentMenuItem->next = item2;
```
Now, when the player presses the arrow keys, the linked list will navigate to the corresponding menu Item. I also added a **select** function that is triggered when the user presses the select key, and it updates the menu depending on what the current node is pointing to. Right now, the game continues if the node is the first item and does nothing otherwise.
```c++
// the select function
void Menu::select() {
	if (currentMenuItem->ID == 1) {
		nextState = new Level("levels/test.txt");
		quit = true;
	}
}
```

## New Collision Mechanics

So the old way of doing things always bugged me. Although I managed to get the auto adjusting margin thing to work, it wasn't very efficient and felt quite weird. Even though I put a lot of time into it, I still feel like it should be scrapped for a better soltion, so that's what I did. So the new collision system works off a **Shape** base class, well it's a struct but what's the difference anyways.. Anyways, the way it works is that there will be different types of shapes that inherit the **shape** base class and there will be a central collision detection function to check for collisions between all the shapes. Each different type of collision will have to be handled differently, but the logic of that will be left up to the collision class. Anyways, here is what the structs look like:
```c++
struct Shape {
	int x, y;
	SHAPE_TYPE type;
	Shape() {}
	Shape(SHAPE_TYPE t) : type(t) {}
	Shape(int _x, int _y) : x(_x), y(_y) {}
	Shape(int _x, int _y, SHAPE_TYPE t) : type(t), x(_x), y(_y) {}
};

struct Rectangle : Shape {
	int w, h;
	Rectangle() : Shape(RECT) {}
	Rectangle(int _x, int _y) : Shape(_x, _y, RECT) {}
	Rectangle(int _x, int _y, int _w, int _h) : Shape(_x, _y, RECT), w(_w), h(_h) {}
};_
```
The *SHAPE_TYPE* data type is just an enumeration to make it easier to tell what type a shape is, for example a *RECT* would represent a rectangle or *CIRC* to represent a square etc.  
After these definitions come the methods themselves. There is a central method to take general shapes and on top of that I created a method to compare rectangles for now. In the future, it can be expanded to different types of shapes for a lot more variety.
```c++
bool isColliding(Shape& shape1, Shape& shape2) {
	if (shape1.type == RECT && shape2.type == RECT) {
		Rectangle& shape1rect = static_cast<Rectangle&>(shape1);
		Rectangle& shape2rect = static_cast<Rectangle&>(shape2);
		return collisionRectRect(shape1rect, shape2rect);
	}
	// temporarily return false for any other case.
	return false;
}

bool collisionRectRect(Rectangle& rect1, Rectangle& rect2) {
	if (rect1.x < rect2.x + rect2.w && rect1.x + rect1.w > rect2.x &&
		rect1.y < rect2.y + rect2.h && rect1.h + rect1.y > rect2.y) {
		// Collision detected
		return true;
	}
	return false;
}
```
None of this has been implemented in the main code yet so that will be something to look out for. It should be very simple though, any part of the code that has a collision box would just be changed to use a shape instead and anytime I have to check for collisions I can just call the central collision check function.
