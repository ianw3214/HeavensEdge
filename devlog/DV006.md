## Basic menu

To start with, I implemented a bare bones menu. In fact, it is so basic that it isn't even a menu, it is more of a transition state. I just put it in first so that I know the state transitions work. All it does right now is show a black screen and go to the level when the player presses the space bar. Let's see how I made this magical thing! First of all, I added 2 files, *menu.cc* and *menu.h*. For now, the menu class doesn't even inherit all the base functions yet, I only have the *handleEvents* function implemented to detect a key press.
```c++
// menu.h
class Menu : public State{
public:
	Menu();
	~Menu() {};
	void handleEvents(SDL_Event);
private:
	void handleKeyPress(SDL_Keycode);
};
```
And the implementation in the source file is quite trivial as well:
```c++
// menu.cc
Menu::Menu() {
}
void Menu::handleEvents(SDL_Event event) {
	if (event.type == SDL_KEYDOWN) {
		handleKeyPress(event.key.keysym.sym);
	}
}
void Menu::handleKeyPress(SDL_Keycode key) {
	if (key == SDLK_SPACE) {
		// go to the level
		nextState = new Level("levels/test.txt");
		quit = true;
	}
}
```
After putting these two files into the project, all I had to do was change *main.cpp* to run a Menu instead of a Level and voila! Super bare bones menu.
