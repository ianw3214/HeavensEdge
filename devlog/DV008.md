## The Plan

Now that the game is at a point where I can actually start working on *GAME* things instead of *ENGINE* things, I'm starting off with a list of things I want to implement.

* Attack Combos
* Level Editor
* Enemy Attacks
* Audio Engine
* Basic Settings

Of course, each of these tasks require a lot of multiple smaller tasks, but this is the basic guideline that I'm gunning for. Of course, on top of coding these features I'll also be adding art and stuff along the way but I'm not gonna plan that for now until I really have a sense of where the game's headed.

## Basic Attack Combos

Instead of planning out how I'm gonna build the combo system, I kind of just jumped right into it and hacked together a simple solution. It is not really elegant but I think it will suffice for the scope of this game. Essentially, I just changed the code in the attack function to check if the hero is dashing to determine whether to execute a combo or not. If *dashing* is true, then the player pressed the button in the middle of a dash which means a combo will execute, in which a *combo1Attack* function will trigger and execute the combo. Here's what the code looks like:

```c++
void Hero::combo1Attack() {
	// stop dashing and perform a combo attack
	dashing = false;
	dashTimer = 0.0f;
	// start attack timer again
	attacking = true;
	attackTimer = HERO::COMBO_1_TIME;
	// update animations
	animState = COMBO1;
	setNextAnimation(faceRight ? IDLE_RIGHT : IDLE_LEFT);
	playAnimation(animState);
	resetAnimationFrame();
}

// part of the new key1Attack function...
void Hero::key1Attack() {
	if (attacking) {
		return;
	}
	if (dashing) {
		std::cout << "HELL YA" << std::endl;
		combo1Attack();
		return;
	}
	// do the other things in the attack function...
}
```

If I want to add more combos, I would simply use different functions and have different if clauses for them. If I do combos within combos, I think I can use an integer to represent which combo is currently executing and then calculate which combo do trigger from there.
