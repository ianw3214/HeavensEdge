## The Plan

Now that the game is at a point where I can actually start working on *GAME* things instead of *ENGINE* things, I'm starting off with a list of things I want to implement.

* Attack Combos
* Level Editor
* Enemy Attacks
* Audio Engine
* Basic Settings

Of course, each of these tasks require a lot of multiple smaller tasks, but this is the basic guideline that I'm gunning for. Of course, on top of coding these features I'll also be adding art and stuff along the way but I'm not gonna plan that for now until I really have a sense of where the game's headed.
