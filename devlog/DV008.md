## The Plan

Now that the game is at a point where I can actually start working on *GAME* things instead of *ENGINE* things, I'm starting off with a list of things I want to implement.

* Attack Combos
* Level Editor
* Enemy Attacks
* Audio Engine
* Basic Settings

Of course, each of these tasks require a lot of multiple smaller tasks, but this is the basic guideline that I'm gunning for. Of course, on top of coding these features I'll also be adding art and stuff along the way but I'm not gonna plan that for now until I really have a sense of where the game's headed.

***

## Basic Attack Combos

Instead of planning out how I'm gonna build the combo system, I kind of just jumped right into it and hacked together a simple solution. It is not really elegant but I think it will suffice for the scope of this game. Essentially, I just changed the code in the attack function to check if the hero is dashing to determine whether to execute a combo or not. If *dashing* is true, then the player pressed the button in the middle of a dash which means a combo will execute, in which a *combo1Attack* function will trigger and execute the combo. Here's what the code looks like:

```c++
void Hero::combo1Attack() {
	// stop dashing and perform a combo attack
	dashing = false;
	dashTimer = 0.0f;
	// start attack timer again
	attacking = true;
	attackTimer = HERO::COMBO_1_TIME;
	// update animations
	animState = COMBO1;
	setNextAnimation(faceRight ? IDLE_RIGHT : IDLE_LEFT);
	playAnimation(animState);
	resetAnimationFrame();
}

// part of the new key1Attack function...
void Hero::key1Attack() {
	if (attacking) {
		return;
	}
	if (dashing) {
		std::cout << "HELL YA" << std::endl;
		combo1Attack();
		return;
	}
	// do the other things in the attack function...
}
```

If I want to add more combos, I would simply use different functions and have different if clauses for them. If I do combos within combos, I think I can use an integer to represent which combo is currently executing and then calculate which combo do trigger from there.

***

## Level Editor

With the basic workings of a combo down, I decided to put it off until I have a more solid foundation of the actual game I want to build. With that, I started working on the level editor. First off, I just added basic game structure that I used in my main game to get a game loop up and running with SDL to the level editor. You can see the commit [here](https://github.com/ianw3214/HeavensEdge/commit/4571eaccde5964dae5211ce3889bb1df3da5ae68).  
Then, I proceeded to add a Tile and Map class, which is almost the same as the Game Engine except I took out a lot of functionality from the Map class. I also got rid of the *delta Time* functionality because it wouldn't be needed in a level editor. One unique function I made was a function to initialize a tile map straight from loading a tile sheet. It looks liek this:
```c++
// initialzie a tile map from loading an image
void Map::initTileIndexMap() {
	// calculate the width and height of the input image
	SDL_Surface* tileSheet = IMG_Load(TILE_SHEET_FILE_PATH.c_str());
	int width = tileSheet->w / TILE_WIDTH, height = tileSheet->h / TILE_HEIGHT;
	// loop through all tiles in the input image
	int numTiles = width * height;
	for (int i = 0; i < numTiles; i++) {
		// calculate the x and y coordinate of the tile
		int x = i % width, y = static_cast<int>(i / width);
		Tile * newTile = new Tile(TILE_SHEET_FILE_PATH, TILE_WIDTH, TILE_HEIGHT, x, y);
		indexMap[i] = newTile;
	}
	return;
}
```
One big design decision I'm making right now is putting things into a constants header. Here's what that looks like right now:
```c++
#pragma once
#include <string>

std::string const TILE_SHEET_FILE_PATH = "../assets/tiles.png";
std::string const OUTPUT_FILE_PATH = "../levels/test.txt";
int const TILE_WIDTH = 64;
int const TILE_HEIGHT = 64;
int const BASE_MAP_WIDTH = 10;
int const BASE_MAP_HEIGHT = 10;
```
The reason I'm doing this is so that I can easily write a wrapper to let the user customize these attributes from within the level editor in the future. I don't want to waste time right now figuring out how to interact with windows to get specific files, so it is a good temporary replacement until I decide to learn how to work with windows.

### Moving the Map

A big part of a level editor is being able to drag the map along to edit tiles at different places. To do the dragging functionality, I had to work with the mouse a bit. To achieve that, I first implemented an *offset* system where the editor would render the map based on an offset. Then, when I want to move the map I can simply adjust the offset and the map will render how I want on screen. Here's what the render function for that looks like:
```c++
void render() {
	SDL_FillRect(display, nullptr, SDL_MapRGB(display->format, 0, 0, 0));
	// render the map
	map->render(display, xOffset, yOffset);
	SDL_UpdateWindowSurface(gWindow);
}
```
Then, I have an event handling function that sets the *SPACE* flag and *LMB* flag to when those two buttons are pressed. Furthermore, when the LMB is pressed, it will record the current mouse position as well as the current offset. Finally, if both buttons are pressed then the update function will update the offset to the new mouse position. With all this combined, the map will act like it is being dragged around by the mouse. The event handling is pretty easy so I will just show the Update function:
```c++
void update() {
	map->update();
	if (SPACE && LMB) {
		int mouseX, mouseY;
		SDL_GetMouseState(&mouseX, &mouseY);
		int xMouseDiff = mouseX - xMouseStartPos;
		int yMouseDiff = mouseY - yMouseStartPos;
		xOffset = xOffsetStart + xMouseDiff;
		yOffset = yOffsetStart + yMouseDiff;
	}
}
```
And just like that, we have the basic structure of the level editor.

### Adding a Tile Palette

The tile palette will be used to choose tiles to put onto the tile map. Essentially it is a menu of tiles, and for menus I like to use *linked lists* to keep track of the menu items. Naturally, I used a linked list here to keep track of all the tiles for the tile palette, here is what it looks like:
```c++
struct tileNode {
	tileNode(Tile* iTile, tileNode* iPrev, tileNode* iNext, int iIndex) : tile(iTile), previous(iPrev), next(iNext), index(iIndex) {}
	Tile * tile;
	tileNode * next;
	tileNode * previous;
	int index;
	int xPos;
};
```
Each node keeps track of it's corresponding tile, obviously. Furthermore, I used a bidirectional linked list so I can keep track of the current Node and render tiles both directions instead of using the first node and calculating from there. This makes traversing the linked list a lot easer at the cost of a bit more space being used up. Also, I have an *index* integer to keep track of the index that the tile represents, so that it is easier to read the index and directly change the tile map when editing. Lastly, I have an **xPos** integer to keep track of the x position of each tile, keeping in mind that all the tiles will have the same y position so I don't need to keep track of that. After that, I made a function to initialize the linked list from the indexMap, this is what it looks like:
```c++
void setTileLinkedList() {
	tileNode * lastNode = nullptr;
	for ( auto const &i : map->getIndexMap() ) {
		int index = i.first;
		Tile * tile = i.second;
		tileNode* temp = new tileNode(tile, lastNode, nullptr, index);
		temp->xPos = index * 100;
		if (lastNode) {
			lastNode->next = temp;
			lastNode = temp;
		}
		else {
			lastNode = temp;
			currentTile = temp;
		}
	}
}
```
Finally, I also have a function to render the tile palette just so the central render function doesn't get too cluttered. Essentially, it renders the current tile and then traverses the linked list both ways to render those tiles. With this, a basic tile palette is now up and running.

### Centering the palette and switching tiles

A small addition I made was centering the current tile of the palette. This was a pretty easy change, I just modified the initial x position and it's done. Then, I added the tile switching functionality, which wasn't too much more work. All I really had to do was add 2 keyboard events, the left and right button, and when these keys are pressed the current tile is switched to *next* or *previous* depending on the pressed key and if the tile nodes exist. The real hard part is centering the currentTile after a change has been made. Here's the update function with the centering functionality:
```c++
void update() {
	// other stuff...

	// update the position of tiles if current tile is not centered
	int center = (SCREEN_WIDTH - TILE_WIDTH) / 2;
	if (currentTile->xPos != center) {
		int distance = static_cast<int>(deltaTime * PALETTE_MOVE_SPEED * (currentTile->xPos < center ? 1 : -1));
		int newX = currentTile->xPos + distance;
		// make sure the movement didn't overshoot the center
		if ((newX > center && currentTile->xPos < center) || (newX < center && currentTile->xPos > center)) {
			// otherwise, correct the distance
			distance = center - currentTile->xPos;
		}
		addTileLinkedListPos(distance);
	}
}
```
The *addTileLinkedListPos* function just adds a certain distance to the x Positions in all tiles in the linekd list. Basically, if the current Tile is not center then the function finds the distance it should move depending on the delta time and moves the tiles accordingly. So when I said before that I wouldn't need deltaTime in the level editor, I was wrong :( Anyways, I then check if the function overshoots the distance, and if it does then I adjust it to exactly the center and then everything is fine and dandy.

### Drawing rectangle(square) outlines

Now that I think about it, I don't know why I call the tiles rectangles because they are clearly squares, although all squares are rectangles so I guess I'm not too far off. Anyways, I fiddled around with using the **renderer** functionality of SDL to draw the outlines, but the renderer wasn't working will with how I have rendering with surfaces set up right now, so I decided to scrap that and just use another surface to render the outlines. It is pretty simple, I have a function that just takes in the coordinates of the target rectangle and draws an outline based on an image I gave it.
```c++
void renderRectOutline(int x, int y) {
	SDL_Rect targetRect = { x - RECT_OUTLINE_MARGIN, y - RECT_OUTLINE_MARGIN, 0, 0};
	if (SDL_BlitSurface(rectOutline, nullptr, display, &targetRect) < 0) {
		std::cout << "Image unable to blit, error: " << SDL_GetError() << std::endl;
	}
}
```

### Calculating rectangle outlines

This was quite a challenge for me to figure out, just because there are so many things I have to keep track of to make everything work right. I will just put in the code and put comments in it in hopes that someone else can understand it too.
```c++
void setMouseOutline() {
	// get the current position of the mouse
	int x, y;
	SDL_GetMouseState(&x, &y);
	// stop executing the function if the mouse is on the palette
	if (y > 600) return;
	// calulate the offset of the map in relation to the origin
	int xMapOffset = xOffset % 64;
	int yMapOffset = yOffset % 64;
	// if the offset is negative, inverse it (don't think inverse is the right word but whatever)
	if (xMapOffset < 0) xMapOffset = 64 + xMapOffset;
	if (yMapOffset < 0) yMapOffset = 64 + yMapOffset;
	// figure out the position of the rectangle the mouse is hovering over (in relation to origin)
	int xOutline = x / 64;
	int yOutline = y / 64;
	// expand the position back to pixel coordinates and apply the offset
	int xFinalPos = xOutline * 64 + xMapOffset;
	int yFinalPos = yOutline * 64 + yMapOffset;
	// if the offset brings the rectangle out of position, bring it back by a tile
	xFinalPos -= xFinalPos > x ? 64 : 0;
	yFinalPos -= yFinalPos > y ? 64 : 0;
	// finally, render the outline
	renderRectOutline(xFinalPos, yFinalPos);
}
```
So hopefully the code explains it well enough, but yeah that's what I got.

### Editing tiles

Finally, we are at the part that makes this an actual level editor: *editing tiles*. First, I wrote a function in my map class that takes a position on the map as well as an index, and changes the tile at the position on the map to the specified index. It's not too complicated so I'll just show the code and let it explain itself.
```c++
void Map::editTileAt(int x, int y, int index) {
	// make sure the input position is within the map
	if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x > BASE_MAP_WIDTH * TILE_WIDTH || y > BASE_MAP_HEIGHT * TILE_HEIGHT) {
		return;
	}
	// make sure the target index is within the index map
	if (index < 0 || index > indexMap.size()) {
		return;
	}
	int xTile = static_cast<int>(x / 64);
	int yTile = static_cast<int>(y / 64);
	int target = yTile * BASE_MAP_WIDTH + xTile;
	tileMap[target] = index;
	return;
}
```
Then, I just had to connect the main application to use the new map function. Instead of putting this in it's own function, I just added it to the update function. It's quite simple really, the code is as follows:
```c++
// change the mouse tile
int x, y;
SDL_GetMouseState(&x, &y);
int target_x = x - xOffset;
int target_y = y - yOffset;
map->editTileAt(target_x, target_y, currentTile->index);
```
First, I calculate the position of the mouse on the actual map by removing the offset, and then I simple call the function and be done with it. I wrapped this in an if statement because I don't want tiles to be changing when the user is panning them map, so I simply added a check for if the space button is pressed.

One other small change I did was add a cursor symbol. This is even simpler so I'll just explain what I did without the code. I have two variables that hold the mouse positions, and every update I simply render the predefined cursor image to where the mouse is, taking the margins into account. Then, to switch between different mouse symbols, I just need an integer to hold what state the mouse is in and change the cursor symbol based on the cursor state. There it is, as simple as that. My next step is to finish file saving and then I will have a basic workable tile editor in place.

### Saving to a file

As it turns out, saving to a file is a lot easier than I expected it to be. All I really had to do was read the data I had in my program and put it into a text file in the right format and it's all done. Anyways, here's what the code looks like, it really is quite simple:
```c++
void Map::saveToFile() {
	std::ofstream target;
	target.open(OUTPUT_FILE_PATH);
	std::cout << "FLAG" << std::endl;
	target << TILE_WIDTH << "\n";
	target << TILE_HEIGHT << "\n";
	target << BASE_MAP_WIDTH << "\n";
	target << BASE_MAP_HEIGHT << "\n";
	target << PLAYER_START_X << "\n";
	target << PLAYER_START_Y << "\n";
	// add all of the tile indices
	// first calculate the width and height of the input image used to calculate the position of each index
	SDL_Surface* tileSheet = IMG_Load(TILE_SHEET_FILE_PATH.c_str());
	int width = tileSheet->w / TILE_WIDTH;
	for ( auto const &i : indexMap) {
		int x = i.first % width;
		int y = static_cast<int>(i.first / width);
		target << i.first << "#" << TILE_SHEET_FILE_PATH << "#" << x << "#" << y << "\n";
	}
	target << "---\n";
	for (int i = 0; i < BASE_MAP_HEIGHT; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < BASE_MAP_WIDTH; j++) {
			target << tileMap[i * BASE_MAP_WIDTH + j];
			if (j == BASE_MAP_WIDTH - 1) target << "\n";
			else target << "#";
		}
	}
	target << "---\n";
	for (int i = 0; i < BASE_MAP_HEIGHT; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < BASE_MAP_WIDTH; j++) {
			target << collisionMap[i * BASE_MAP_WIDTH + j];
			if (j == BASE_MAP_WIDTH - 1) target << "\n";
			else target << "#";
		}
	}
	target.close();
}
```
And yes, it looks quite long but it's just the for loops spitting out the map data that makes it look long.

### Collision tile editing

This seemed pretty easy for me at first, but I ended up spending quite a bit of time on this. First, I created a new boolean called *collisionMode* that will determine whether the user is editing the collision map or the tile map. Then, I have a boolean called *collisionAdd* which determines if the user is adding or taking away collision tiles. This seems unecessary, but the way I implemented tile editing calls for it. At first, I went for a inverse kind of approach, where I would make the tile a collision tile if it wasn't one already and vice versa. However, I failed to realize that the editing function is actually called multiple times per mouse click, because I wanted the user to be able to hold the mouse button and edit multiple tiles at once. This meant that a single click would trigger the function multiple times, which is not useful for collision tile editing. Therefore, I went with this approach and made a completely new function for collision tile editing.
```c++
void Map::editCollision(int x, int y, bool add) {
	// calculate the index to change from input coordinates...
	collisionMap[target] = add ? 1 : 0;
	return;
}
```
You will notice that it is similar to the tile editing function, just that it takes a boolean instead of an integer and only changes the target tile to a 0 or 1. Then I also made a completely new render function just for the collision tiles:
```c++
void Map::renderCollisionTiles(SDL_Surface* display, int x, int y) {
	for (unsigned int i = 0; i < collisionMap.size(); i++) {
		int tileX = (i % BASE_MAP_WIDTH) * TILE_WIDTH;
		int tileY = (i / BASE_MAP_WIDTH) * TILE_HEIGHT;
		int key = collisionMap.at(i);
		SDL_Rect targetRect = { tileX + x, tileY + y, 0, 0 };
		if (key == 1){
			if (SDL_BlitSurface(collisionImage, nullptr, display, &targetRect) < 0) {
				std::cout << "Image unable to blit, error: " << SDL_GetError() << std::endl;
			}
		}
	}
}
```
Finally, I just have to call these functions in the main application and bind a few keys and everything is bueno. All that connecting stuff is pretty easy, so I'll just add a link to the commit [here](https://github.com/ianw3214/HeavensEdge/commit/7316cf1ea12d991e048c205ee1160565b1074e93) if you want to see it.

## Frame rate drop

Now that I have a level editor in place, I tried adding a bigger map to the game. Unfortunately, I also discovered that the game lags massively when the loaded map spans the whole screen. To figure out how bad it was, I added a frame rate counter into the engine class, here is how it works:
```c++
void Engine::update(){
    // other update code...
	if (fpsCounter > 1.0f) {
		fps = frames;
		std::cout << "FPS: " << fps << std::endl;
		frames = 0;
		fpsCounter = 0.0f;
	}
	else {
		fpsCounter += deltaTime;
		frames++;
	}
}
```
Overall pretty simple, just calculates how many frames elapsed in a second and that's the fps. Anyways, when only a little bit of the map is loaded, everything is pretty much fine and the game runs at 140 ish fps. However, when I move to the center and the map spans the whole screen, the fps drops to 50 or 40, which is really low for any game really. I found the bottleneck not much later, it was caused by the rendering of the map. I suspected the way I did things would cause problems, but past me left it for future me to fix, and now I'm stuck trying to figure it out. I tried optimizing the surfaces, but there is no good way to do that with how I structured the code. For some reason, I create the game state before I initialize the engine, so there is no way to find the format of the display to optimize the surfaces. I don't have a solution right now, but I'll probably sleep on it and hopefully find some way to fix it soon. For those interested, [here](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/05_optimized_surface_loading_and_soft_stretching/index.php) is the tutorial that I've been looking at. There is also another solution of using textures instead of surfaces but the structure of my code wouldn't do much good there either.

### Fixing the frame rate drop

After some restructuring of the engine, I was able to rescue the frame rate. My solution was to separate initializing the SDL subsystems and setting the initial state, so I could initialize the window before initializing the state. Then, I used a static *SDL_Surface* in the Tile class for the display, and set it's value to the game window surface. That way, every tile that is initialized will be optimized correctly and the frame rate won't drop as much. Here's the new constructor for the tile class:
```c++
Tile::Tile(std::string path, int w, int h, int xPos, int yPos){
    // load the sprite sheet to a temporary surface
    SDL_Surface * tempSurface = IMG_Load(path.c_str());
    if(!tempSurface){
        std::cout << "Image unable to load, error: " << IMG_GetError() << std::endl;
    }
	// optimize the temporary surface and set it to the sprite sheet
	spriteSheet = SDL_ConvertSurface(tempSurface, screenSurface->format, NULL);
	if (spriteSheet == NULL) {
		std::cout << "Unable to optimize image, Error: " << SDL_GetError() << std::endl;
	}
	SDL_FreeSurface(tempSurface);
    // set up the blit Rect of the tile
    blitRect = {xPos*w, yPos*h, w, h};
}
```
Now, I have to optimize the surfaces for everything else, but it shouldn't be too hard now that I have the engine structure down. However, a new problem occured now that the fps problem is fixed. The frames are updating too fast and the movement isn't working because of every frame, the movement distance is rounded down to 0. To fix this, I will probably implement some sort of update rate cap so the entities can move a proper distance every frame.

### Adding a frame rate cap

Adding a frame rate cap was pretty easy, I'll just show the new code for the engine update function and explain later.
```c++
/**
 * Updates the game state and calculates time difference between each call
 */
void Engine::update(){
	// calculate the deltaTime
    currentTime = SDL_GetTicks();
    deltaTime = static_cast<float>(currentTime - lastTime)/1000.0f;
    lastTime = currentTime;
	// handle events before each update ...
	// call the update function of the state ...
	// render the state after each update ...
    // check to see if the state should be changed ...
	// get the time to see if frame rate needs to be capped
	int tempTime = SDL_GetTicks();
	int difference = tempTime - lastTime;
	// if the difference in time is too small, delay the next update
	if (difference < timePerFrame) {
		SDL_Delay(timePerFrame - difference);
	}
}
```
First of all, you may have noticed that I moved the *handleEvents* function and the *render* function into the main update function. That is because I added a timer to the end of the function too, which means if the functions weren't combined the timer would only take into account the time for the update function and not the render and handleEvents functions, which isn't what I want. So after everything runs, I just calculate the elapsed time and if it is too low, delay the difference between the expected time and the actual time.

## Line to Line collisions

For the next enemy I want to make, I will need line collisions so I decided to implement the collision system first. The algorithm I used is kind of complicated, I don't understand it that well myself. You can check out the actual algorithm [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4977491/determining-if-two-line-segments-intersect/4977569#4977569). Here's what the final collision code looks like:
```c++
bool collisionLineLine(const Line& line1, const Line& line2) {
	float denominator = ((line1.x2 - line1.x) * (line2.y2 - line2.y) - (line1.y2 - line1.y) * (line2.x2 - line2.x));
	float numerator1 = ((line1.y - line2.y) * (line2.x2 - line2.x) - (line1.x - line2.x) * (line2.y2 - line2.y));
	float numerator2 = ((line1.y - line2.y) * (line1.x2 - line1.x) - (line1.x - line2.x) * (line1.y2 - line1.y));
	// temporarily return false if the lines are parallel
	if (denominator == 0) return false;
	float r = numerator1 / denominator;
	float s = numerator2 / denominator;
	return (r >= 0 && r <= 1) && (s >= 0 && s <= 1);
}
```
The algorithm can't detect an intersection if they are parallel so hopefully that won't come up too much. Anyhow, I now have a working line collision algorithm and to make a line to rectangle algorithm, I just separate the rectangle into 4 lines and check for intersections on all 4 sides.

## Making a new enemy

The first enemy I want to try making is one that will charge upon the player upon sight. The line to rect collision I wrote before will come in handy for the AI here. Before I start coding the new enemy, I had to change some of the base entity code. Mainly, I added a pointer to the entity list in the base entity class as a static variable, since enemies might need to work their AI off of the other entities too and not just the player. Anyhow, the code is quite simple so I won't go into detail about how I changed the code.

So, the first new enemy I designed is one that would charge at the player upon sight. To do this, I built an enemy on top of the base enemy class. Then, on each update, I simply see if the player is in sight of the enemy. I achieve this effect by making 4 lines for each direction of the enemy, and then checking if the lines collide with the player. If they do, then the enemy will charge towards that certain direction. Here's what the update function looks like:
```c++
void ChargeEnemy::update(float delta) {
	// update the position/animations of the sprite
	sprite->update(delta);
	sprite->setPos(x, y);
	// update the collision box as well
	collisionBox->x = x + collisionMarginX;
	collisionBox->y = y + collisionMarginY;
	// remove the enemy if it's health is below 0
	if (health <= 0) {
		REMOVE = true;
	}
	// if the creature is not charging, determine if it should
	if (!charging) {
		// make 4 collision lines to determine if the player is within sight
		Line up(x + 32, y + 32, x + 32, y - 400 + 32);
		Line right(x + 32, y + 32, x + 400 + 32, y + 32);
		Line down(x + 32, y + 32, x + 32, y + 400 + 32);
		Line left(x + 32, y + 32, x - 400 + 32, y + 32);
		if (isColliding(up, *(hero->getCollisionBox()))) {
			charging = true;
			direction = 0;
		}
		else if (isColliding(right, *(hero->getCollisionBox()))) {
			charging = true;
			direction = 1;
		}
		else if (isColliding(down, *(hero->getCollisionBox()))) {
			charging = true;
			direction = 2;
		}
		else if (isColliding(left, *(hero->getCollisionBox()))) {
			charging = true;
			direction = 3;
		}
	}
	// otherwise, update the creature accordingly
	else {
		Creature::move(direction, CHARGE_ENEMY::CHARGESPEED * delta);
		// update the timer
		chargeTimer += delta;
		if (chargeTimer >= CHARGE_ENEMY::CHARGE_TIME) {
			chargeTimer = 0.0f;
			charging = false;
		}
		// only damage the player if the enemy is charging
		if (isColliding(*collisionBox, *hero->getCollisionBox())) {
			hero->takeDamage(3);
		}
	}
}
```
In addition to making this new enemy, I also made sure the player had an invincible timer so it wouldn't just die upon contact with an enemy. The code for that is quite easy, I just have a timer that starts every time the player is hit and if the timer is active then the player won't take damage. Anyways, with this, I now have a working enemy that can damage the player.

## Loading sound

So as it turns out, loading sound is a lot easier than I thought it would be. I don't really need a separate part of the engine to play audio since I only need 2 lines to play an audio clip.
```c++
// play a sound
Mix_Chunk * temp = Mix_LoadWAV("assets/sounds/atk.wav");
Mix_PlayChannel(-1, temp, 0);
```
As you can see, this is really REALLY simple. Also, if I want to mute audio across the game I just put in:
```c++
Mix_Volume(-1, 0);
```
So I guess I put in audio now? With this, I can start working on the actual game content I suppose.

## Thoughts and Dreams

I'm quite happy with the progress I've made. Not only do I have a kind of functional game, I built a level editor that works! I think I'll start working on improving the level editor next week as well as implementing basic NPCs. After all, what would a game be if there weren't any NPCs! I already have quite a few ideas for what I'm going to implement so I honestly can't wait to start developing.

On top of developing the game itself, I think I'm at the point where I can start writing my devlogs somewhere other than the github repository. I might start setting up a site of sorts to put my content on, and I might start writing tutorials as well. That's all I have to say so here's a bear ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
