## Adding music

After making 2 music tracks, I realized that I haven't streamlined loading music into the game, so I put some more functions into the *UTIL* class. I'm not really sure if I even need it but I did it anyways, and here's what it looks like:
```c++
void UTIL::playTrack(std::string file, int channel, bool repeat) {
	Mix_Chunk * temp = Mix_LoadWAV(file.c_str());
	if (Mix_PlayChannel(channel, temp, repeat ? -1 : 0) == -1) {
		std::cout << "Error playing track: " << file << ", ERROR: " << Mix_GetError() << std::endl;
	}
}

void UTIL::playTrack(std::string file, int channel, bool repeat, int ms) {
	Mix_Chunk * temp = Mix_LoadWAV(file.c_str());
	if (Mix_FadeInChannel(channel, temp, repeat ? -1 : 0, ms) == -1) {
		std::cout << "Error playing track: " << file << ", ERROR: " << Mix_GetError() << std::endl;
	}
}
```
To play a new track, I just use the new *playTrack* function with the desired path and channel and I'm pretty much done. I finally got to use the *exit* function for the menu State, where I put the music exit functionality in. I think that's about all I have to say about that, so yeah it works now!

## Smoother level transitions

The level transitions were re	ally choppy because there was no delay, it was instant map change when the player hit the desired collision blocks. To make it smoother, I added a fade out functionality when the player hit the right tiles, so that it wouldn't seem so sudden. Here's what the update function looks like now:
```c++
void Level::update(float delta) {
	// if the map is transitioning, just handle that logic and skip the rest of the update
	if (transitioning) {
		transitionTimer -= delta;
		if (transitionTimer <= 0.0f) {
			quit = true;
		}
		else {
			// update the alpha of the overlay if not yet transitioned
			int alpha = static_cast<int>((1.0f - transitionTimer / 1.0f) * 255);
			blackOverlay->setAlpha(alpha);
		}
		return;
	}
	// other update stuff here...
}
```
I still set the next level first when the player hits the desired tiles, but instead of quitting the current level right away, I added a timer and the level will transition when the timer finishes counting down. I also implemented the fade out by adding a pure black sprite to the render and changing it's alpha to increase linearly relative to time. Overall, it creates a nice effect when exiting a level and improves the game greatly in my opinion.

## Adding sound effects

So I added some sound effects, but there's really nothing technical to show so I really just wanted to put that out there. If you are interested you can see the commit [here](), otherwise just smile and move on :)

## The final log

I decided to stop the project and don't really know what to put here, so here's some smiley faces :) :) :)
