## Adding music

After making 2 music tracks, I realized that I haven't streamlined loading music into the game, so I put some more functions into the *UTIL* class. I'm not really sure if I even need it but I did it anyways, and here's what it looks like:
```c++
void UTIL::playTrack(std::string file, int channel, bool repeat) {
	Mix_Chunk * temp = Mix_LoadWAV(file.c_str());
	if (Mix_PlayChannel(channel, temp, repeat ? -1 : 0) == -1) {
		std::cout << "Error playing track: " << file << ", ERROR: " << Mix_GetError() << std::endl;
	}
}

void UTIL::playTrack(std::string file, int channel, bool repeat, int ms) {
	Mix_Chunk * temp = Mix_LoadWAV(file.c_str());
	if (Mix_FadeInChannel(channel, temp, repeat ? -1 : 0, ms) == -1) {
		std::cout << "Error playing track: " << file << ", ERROR: " << Mix_GetError() << std::endl;
	}
}
```
To play a new track, I just use the new *playTrack* function with the desired path and channel and I'm pretty much done. I finally got to use the *exit* function for the menu State, where I put the music exit functionality in. I think that's about all I have to say about that, so yeah it works now!
