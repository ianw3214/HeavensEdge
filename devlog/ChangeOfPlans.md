# Change of Plans

***

As it turns out, OpenGL is a lot harder than I thought it would be to learn. I started this project as something for me to work on for my 100 days of code challenge, so my goal isn't as much to learn as it is to build and ship a complete product. For that reason, I will use SDL2, which is something I'm a lot more comfortable with, instead of openGL.

That being said, I won't stop learning openGL. I still have other side projects going on, I am simply not focusing on openGL right now, that is all.
