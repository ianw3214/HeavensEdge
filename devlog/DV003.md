## Delta times

Because every computer running a game has different specs, we can't know for sure how long each game loop will take. This means that we have to adjust things in the game with how long each loop takes on each machine to make the game run consistently across different machines. To do this, I put a *deltaTime* variable in the game engine that calculates the difference in time between two update calls. Here's the code inside the engine update function:
```c++
currentTime = SDL_GetTicks();
deltaTime = static_cast<float>(currentTime - lastTime)/1000.0;
lastTime = currentTime;
this->currentState->update(deltaTime);
```

With the delta time added to the engine code, we can now use it to call update functions from other classes as well. I added a delta time parameter to the map and tiles update call because it might be used for animation in the future.
```c++
// Map update function
void Map::update(float delta) {
    for(auto const& tile : tileMap) {
        tile.second->update(delta);
    }
}

// Tile update function
void Tile::update(float delta){
    // can be changed to include animated tiles in the future
}
```

## Adding the player class

Because I want the player to be able to play as different characters, I'm separating the **Hero** class with the **Player** class. Essentially, the player class contains a hero object and the player class will do all the event handling. After processing incoming events, the Player class decides what methods to call from the hero class, which will vary depending on what hero the player is playing.

![UML Diagram of player class](../UML/Player.png)

Above is a UML diagram of how the Player-Hero class system is going to work. I put in an Archer and Knight class to give an example of how the Hero will be the parent class to all different subclasses.

Here's the header file of the base hero class:
```c++
class Hero : public AnimatedSprite{

public:
    Hero(int, int);

    void update(float);
    void render(SDL_Surface*, SDL_Rect);

    void move(int, float);
    void stopMove(int);
protected:
    int health;
    int speed;
};
```
The implementation for most of the methods are trivial, but the move function is a bit weird. Instead of just taking a flag for direction, it also takes in a float. This is because the hero's movement depends on the delta time. If the game suddenly lag spikes, I still want the hero to move as if the the spike never happened, so instead of updating movement by a fixed value, I added a delta Time calculation to it. Here's what it looks like:
```c++
void Hero::move(int direction, float delta){
    // 0 - up, 1 - right, 2 - down, 3 - left
    if(direction == 0){ y -= speed*delta; }
    if(direction == 1){ x += speed*delta; }
    if(direction == 2){ y += speed*delta; }
    if(direction == 3){ x -= speed*delta; }
}
```

And controlling the hero class, we have the player class:
```c++
class Player : public Entity{

public:
    Player();
    Player(Hero*);

    void handleEvents(SDL_Event);
    void update(float);
    void render(SDL_Surface*, SDL_Rect);
private:
    Hero * hero;

    bool UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT;

    void handleKeyPress(SDL_Keycode);
    void handleKeyRelease(SDL_Keycode);
};
```

The *update* and *render* functions are trivial as well, but the movement controls as well as event handling is a bit different.

***

## Movement

The way I handle movement in my games is a bit unconventional because this is how I used to do it in flash, but it doesn't cost much memory so I like to just stick to my guns. In my player event handler, I detect both *KEYDOWN* events and *KEYUP* events, which correspond to when the player presses a key and releases a key. I also have 4 movement flags to store which keys are pressed, so when the user presses a key, a movement flag will be set to true and the opposite happens when the user releases a key.
```c++
void Player::handleEvents(SDL_Event event){
    // the helper functions just look at the pressed key and change flags accordingly
    if(event.type == SDL_KEYDOWN){
        handleKeyPress(event.key.keysym.sym);
    }else if(event.type == SDL_KEYUP){
        handleKeyRelease(event.key.keysym.sym);
    }
}
```
The update function checks to see which flags are pressed and then moves the hero accordingly. To make the movement smooth, we also take delta time into account so that differences in time between update calls won't affect the movement. I simply added this code into the player update function:
```c++
if(UP){ hero->move(0, delta); }
if(DOWN){ hero->move(2, delta); }
if(LEFT){ hero->move(3, delta); }
if(RIGHT){ hero->move(1, delta); }
```
And that's all the code I have for movement calculations.

## Migrate to Visual Studio

The code base at this point is getting quite large, so Atom isn't quite cutting it anymore. Also, the debugging tools built into Visual Studio is going to be really helpful in the future, so it was the best choice for me.

To learn how to use SDL with Visual Studio, there's a good tutorial by [Lazyfoo](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/)

## Change movement

After some thinking/planning, I decided that the old way of handling movement wasn't going to go well with the gameplay. I decided to change the way movement is handled so that the player can't move diagonally. To do this, I separated the movement flags from the key input flags so that I can handle movement calculations separately. The player header now contains different movement/key press flags as well as a new method to process pressed keys.
```c++
bool moveUp, moveDown, moveLeft, moveRight;
bool upPress, downPress, leftPress, rightPress;
...
void processKeyEvents();
```
The player still handles key presses just like before, except it now changes the movement flags only. The **processKeyEvents** now handles changing the movement flags depending on what key press flags are true.
```c++
void Player::processKeyEvents() {
	if (upPress && !downPress && !leftPress && !rightPress) {
		moveUp = true, moveDown = false, moveLeft = false, moveRight =false;
	}
	else if (!upPress && downPress && !leftPress && !rightPress) {
		moveUp = false, moveDown = true, moveLeft = false, moveRight = false;
	}
	else if (!upPress && !downPress && leftPress && !rightPress) {
		moveUp = false, moveDown = false, moveLeft = true, moveRight = false;
	}
	else if (!upPress && !downPress && !leftPress && rightPress) {
		moveUp = false, moveDown = false, moveLeft = false, moveRight = true;
	}
	if (!upPress && !downPress && !rightPress && !leftPress) {
		moveUp = false, moveDown = false, moveLeft = false, moveRight = false;
	}
}
```
The code right now is quite messy and there's probably a better way to do it, but it'll work for now. As you can see, I only change movement flags if they are the only key pressed. Then if no keys are pressed, I set all of the movement flags to false. This ensures that the player only moves in one direction because only 1 of the movement flags can be true at a time.

## The camera

The camera is represented by an SDL_Rect, which is just a set of 4 numbers corresponding to the x, y, width and height of a rectangle. So far, the camera is just set in one position and doesn't move at all. To have the camera follow the correct position, I first modified the player class to have a method that returns the center x and y, which is just the coordinates corresponding to the center point of the player sprite. The calculations are all hard coded for now, but should be calculated from the hero sprite width/height in the future.
```c++
int Player::getCenterX() { return hero->getX()+32; }
int Player::getCenterY() { return hero->getY()+32; }
```
In the update function of the level class, we then set the camera position to match the player positions from these functions.
```c++
// update the camera position to match the player
camera.x = player->getCenterX() - camera.w / 2;
camera.y = player->getCenterY() - camera.h / 2;
```
And just like that, our camera should follow our player along on the screen.

## Tile collision

Because maps aren't going to be perfectly rectangular, *tile collision* is going to play an important role in the game. Before we actually touch any of the hero movement code, let's start be adding collision maps to the Map class so we can load the collision data from a text file as well.
```c++
// In the map header file add these
std::vector<int> collisionData;
void lineToCollisionData(std::string);
// the new loadFromFile function
bool Map::loadFromFile(std::string file){
    std::ifstream fileStream;
    fileStream.open(file);
    std::string line;
    int counter = 0;        // counter to keep track of which line we're reading
    bool onMapData = false, onCollisionData = false;
	while (getline(fileStream, line)) {
		// TODO: change conditionals to not depend on order
		if (counter == 0) {   // first line is the width of each tile
			int width = std::stoi(line, nullptr);
			tileWidth = width;
		}
		if (counter == 1) {   // second line is the height of each tile
			int height = std::stoi(line, nullptr);
			tileHeight = height;
		}
		if (counter == 2) {   // third line is the width of each map in tiles
			int width = std::stoi(line, nullptr);
			mapWidth = width;
		}
		if (counter == 3) {   // third line is the width of each map in tiles
			int height = std::stoi(line, nullptr);
			mapHeight = height;
		}
		if (onCollisionData) {	// read the numbers into the collision data
			lineToCollisionData(line);
		}
		if (line == "***") {	// stop reading into map data when token is reached
			onCollisionData = true;
		}
		if (onMapData && !onCollisionData) {  // read the numbers into the map data
			lineToMapData(line);
		}
		if (line == "---") {  // stop reading into tile map when token is reached
			onMapData = true;
		}
		if (counter > 3 && !onMapData && !onCollisionData) {
			// reading tile info to tileMap
			lineToTileMap(line);
		}
		counter++;
	}
    return true;
}
// The function to load file data to collision data
/**
* Helper function to load file data to collision data
* @param line The line to be parsed
*/
void Map::lineToCollisionData(std::string line) {
	// each token is seperated by a #

	std::string token = "";

	for (char const & c : line) {
		if (c == '#') {
			int key = std::stoi(token, nullptr);
			if (key == 0) { collisionData.push_back(0); }
			else { collisionData.push_back(1); }
			token = "";
		}
		else {
			token += c;
		}
	}
	collisionData.push_back(std::stoi(token, nullptr));
	return;
}
```

## Tile collision in the Hero Class

The actual collision handling logic is put in the hero class, so that the move function can check against the tile map every time. Starting off, I just used a brute force approach that checks every single tile for a collision during every single loop. *Note* that this is a very inefficient approach and there are many ways to optimize it, but it's what I'm building off of as a starting point. First, we make some changes to the hero header file.
```c++
 class Hero : public AnimatedSprite{
 public:
    Hero(int, int);
  	// getter/setter functions
  	void setCollisionMap(std::vector<int>);
  	void setLevelWidth(int);
  	void setTileSize(int);

    void update(float);
    void render(SDL_Surface*, SDL_Rect);

    void move(int, float);
protected:
    int health;
    int speed;

  	std::vector<int> collisionMap;
 	bool validateMovement(int, int);
 	int levelWidth, tileSize;
    bool checkCollision(int, int);
};
```
Of course, that means we have to put some getter functions from our map class so we can pass attributes like level width and tile size to our hero class. The way to do so is quite trivial so I won't get into how that is done. The level class gets the map data when it initializes and then passes it down to the player class, which then passes it on to the hero class.

Finally, in the hero class, we change the move function to check for tile collisions.
```c++
void Hero::move(int direction, float delta){
    // 0 - up, 1 - right, 2 - down, 3 - left
	int units = static_cast<int>(speed*delta);
	for (int i = 0; i < units; i++) {
		int newX = x;
		int newY = y;
		if (direction == 0) { newY--; }
		if (direction == 1) { newX++; }
		if (direction == 2) { newY++; }
		if (direction == 3) { newX--; }
		// if a collision occured, check for a small margin
		if (checkCollision(newX, newY)) {
			// check if the margin is small enough for the player to be adjusted
		}
		else {
			// otherwise, set the new x and y positions
			x = newX;
			y = newY;
		}
	}
}
```

We also made a new checkCollision function so that the move function doesn't get too cluttered. For now, the collision checking checks against all tiles in the collision map, but it can be heavily optimized.

```c++
bool Hero::checkCollision(int xpos, int ypos) {
	// TODO: optimize collision checking by shrinking checking range
	for (int i = 0; i < collisionMap.size(); i++) {
		// for now, check every single tile for a collision
		if (collisionMap.at(i) == 1) {	// 1 means it is a collidable tile
			// check the coords of the tile against player position
			int targetX = (i % levelWidth) * tileSize;
			int targetY = static_cast<int>(i / levelWidth) * tileSize;
			// first check x coordinates
			if (xpos + tileWidth > targetX && xpos < (targetX + tileSize)) {
				// check y coordinates
				if (ypos + tileHeight > targetY && ypos < (targetY + tileSize)) {
					// return true only if both x and y intersect
					return true;
				}
			}
		}
	}
	// return false if no collision happened
	return false;
}
```

The 2 main flaws with the current solution is that it is very inefficient as of right now, and that it is nearly impossible for the player to run down a 1 wide gap. I put them down as TODOs for now, but it will be something to look into in the future.

## Thoughts??

While working through new code, I also go back to fix/polish my old code from time to time so things are looking a bit more clean. The auto adjusting for the tile collision seems like something interesting to implement so I'm quite excited to try and figure that out! I'm going pretty strong on progress and hopefully everything keeps rolling along :)
