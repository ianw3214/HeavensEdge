## Delta times

Because every computer running a game has different specs, we can't know for sure how long each game loop will take. This means that we have to adjust things in the game with how long each loop takes on each machine to make the game run consistently across different machines. To do this, I put a *deltaTime* variable in the game engine that calculates the difference in time between two update calls. Here's the code inside the engine update function:
```c++
currentTime = SDL_GetTicks();
deltaTime = static_cast<float>(currentTime - lastTime)/1000.0;
lastTime = currentTime;
this->currentState->update(deltaTime);
```
