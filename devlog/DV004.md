## Hero tile collision auto adjustment

That is a really long name but I really don't know what else to call it. Essentially, with the way tile collision works right now it is nearly impossible for the player to move into a one wide gap. My plan is to have a system where it detects if the player wants to go inside a 1 wide gap and then adjust the hero position to align with the gap if the conditions fit.

To achieve this, I first changed the way heroes move. Before, I was adding the distance that the hero should move to its' position, but it now updates the position by 1 each time until it reaches the target distance. Now we have something like this.
```c++
int units = static_cast<int>(speed*delta);
for (int i = 0; i < units; i++) {
    int newX = x;
    int newY = y;
    if (direction == 0) { newY--; }
    if (direction == 1) { newX++; }
    if (direction == 2) { newY++; }
    if (direction == 3) { newX--; }
}
```
This makes our collision checking code easier because we don't have to account for a large delta time messing up our collision code. The next step is to check if there player is moving up/down or left/right so we can decide which way to check the alignment for.
```c++
if(direction ==  0 || direction == 2){
    // adjust for x axis
}else if(direction == 1 || direction == 3){
    // adjust for y axis
}
```
Now that we know which axis we are checking for, we can check if the player is close enough to the border of a tile. If it is close enough, we will adjust it to align with that tile in the specified axis, and if not we don't move.

The first part to implementing the auto adjusting is figuring out which tile the player is trying to align to. To do this, we find the remainder after dividing the player position by the tileSize. If the remainder is small or big enough, we know the player is near the border of a tile. If that is the case, we then figure out which tile the player is close to and do future calculations based on that.
```c++
int key = x % tileSize;
if (key < 20 || key > tileSize - 20) {
    // find the x position of the target tile
    int tileX = static_cast<int>(x / tileSize) * tileSize;
    // find the difference between the target tile and current position
    int difference = std::abs(x - tileX);
    // because already know the player is close to the border of a tile, so
    // if the difference too big, then we took the wrong tile to adjust to
    if (difference > 20) {
        tileX += tileSize;
    }
    // check the target collision tile to see if movement is valid
}
```
After finding the target position to adjust to, we then check if the tile that the player will move to is a valid tile. Here is an example for moving upwards:
```c++
// get the target position after the auto adjusting
int tileNumX = tileX / 64;
int tileNumY = newY / 64;
if (direction == 0) {
    // check the tile above
    int target = tileNumY * levelWidth + tileNumX;
    // if the target tile is a valid tile(in the map)
    if (target >= 0 || target < collisionMap.size()) {
        // then check if the target tile is valid for movement
        if (collisionMap.at(target) == 0) {
            x = tileX;
        }
        // if it isn't then don't do anything
    }
}
```
And with that system implemented for all directions, here is what the final movement code looks like.
```c++
int units = static_cast<int>(speed*delta);
for (int i = 0; i < units; i++) {
    int newX = x;
    int newY = y;
    if (direction == 0) { newY--; }
    if (direction == 1) { newX++; }
    if (direction == 2) { newY++; }
    if (direction == 3) { newX--; }
    // if a collision occured, check for a small margin
    if (checkCollision(newX, newY)) {
        // check if the margin is small enough for the player to be adjusted
        if (direction == 0 || direction == 2) {
            int key = x % tileSize;

            if (key < 20 || key > tileSize - 20) {
                int tileX = static_cast<int>(x / tileSize) * tileSize;
                int difference = std::abs(x - tileX);
                // if the difference too big, then we took the wrong tile to adjust to
                if (difference > 20) {
                    tileX += tileSize;
                }
                int tileNumX = tileX / 64;
                int tileNumY = newY / 64;
                if (direction == 0) {
                    // check the tile above
                    int target = tileNumY * levelWidth + tileNumX;
                    if (target >= 0 || target < collisionMap.size()) {
                        if (collisionMap.at(target) == 0) {
                            x = tileX;
                        }
                    }
                }
                if (direction == 2) {
                    // check the tile above
                    tileNumY += 1;
                    int target = tileNumY * levelWidth + tileNumX;
                    if (target >= 0 || target < collisionMap.size()) {
                        if (collisionMap.at(target) == 0) {
                            x = tileX;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }else if (direction == 1 || direction == 3) {
            int key = y % tileSize;
            if (key < 20 || key > tileSize - 20) {
                int tileY = static_cast<int>(y / tileSize) * tileSize;
                int difference = std::abs(y - tileY);
                // if the difference too big, then we took the wrong tile to adjust to
                if (difference > 20) {
                    tileY += tileSize;
                }
                // TODO: Check collision tiles to make sure adjusting only happens when
                //		the player is moving towards non empty tile
                int tileNumX = newX / 64;
                int tileNumY = tileY / 64;
                if (direction == 1) {
                    // check the tile above
                    tileNumX += 1;
                    int target = tileNumY * levelWidth + tileNumX;
                    if (target >= 0 || target < collisionMap.size()) {
                        if (collisionMap.at(target) == 0) {
                            y = tileY;
                        }
                    }
                }
                if (direction == 3) {
                    // check the tile above
                    int target = tileNumY * levelWidth + tileNumX;
                    if (target >= 0 || target < collisionMap.size()) {
                        if (collisionMap.at(target) == 0) {
                            y = tileY;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        // otherwise, don't do anything
    }
    else {
        // otherwise, set the new x and y positions
        x = newX;
        y = newY;
    }
}
```
Again, all the code right now is very unoptimized, but with a little bit of work everything should be quite fast and modular as well.

## Smooth Camera Movement

With the new auto adjusting code, the camera movement can feel somewhat twitchy, so I decided to implement smoother camera movement. I'm not sure if it will help with the twitching, but it's probably a good system to have anyways. Currently, the camera updates it's position by setting it's x and y to be equal to that of the players. To make it smoother, the camera will now have a movement speed and adjust itself based on relation to position of player instead of setting the position to be absolutely equal. Here is the new camera movement function:
```c++
void Level::updateCamera() {
	// get target camera position
	int targetX = player->getCenterX() - camera.w / 2;
	int targetY = player->getCenterY() - camera.h / 2;
	// update the camera position to match the player
	if (std::abs(targetX - camera.x) > camSpeed) {
		std::cout << "FLAG" << std::endl;
		if (targetX > camera.x) {
			camera.x += camSpeed;
		}
		else {
			camera.x -= camSpeed;
		}
	}
	else {
		camera.x = targetX;
	}
	if (std::abs(targetY - camera.y) > camSpeed) {
		if (targetY > camera.y) {
			camera.y += camSpeed;
		}
		else {
			camera.y -= camSpeed;
		}
	}
	else {
		camera.y = targetY;
	}
}
```
After testing a bit, the camera still twitches a little when the player auto adjust, but overall it does feel a bit smoother.

## Basic movement function optimization

There are some small things I did to make the code cleaner and more optimized. You can check out the changes from the [commit log](https://github.com/ianw3214/HeavensEdge/commit/d3a7d35b12b38a51c852a3ec2bb661b71eefff1f)

## More Camera Smoothing

I figured out that the jittery camera problem from before was because the player would overshoot the gap when the auto adjusting happened so the camera would follow the overshot position for a frame or two and then cut back to the correct position. To fix this, I just added a margin of error for the camera to have between it's position and the player. Here's the new camera movement function.
```c++
// camera margin is initialized to 30
if (std::abs(targetX - camera.x) > camMargin) {
    if (targetX > camera.x) { camera.x += camSpeed; }
    else { camera.x -= camSpeed; }
}
if (std::abs(targetY - camera.y) > camMargin) {
    if (targetY > camera.y) { camera.y += camSpeed; }
    else { camera.y -= camSpeed; }
}
```
