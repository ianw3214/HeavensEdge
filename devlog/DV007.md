## Basic Enemy AI

So far, enemies have been temporary orange squares that just stand there, which is really boring. That's why I decided to make them moving orange squares, just to spice things up a bit. I started out with a simple AI, to just have an enemy that moves around randomly. To do this, I gave the enemies a movement timer that tells the game when to change the direction of enemies, and move the enemy in the specified direction every update. With this, I had to add the collision data of the map into the enemy class, so that the enemies wouldn't walk into walls. The collision functions are the same as for the hero class, which means I'll have to refactor that somehow in the future. Here's the new update function for the enemy:
```c++
void Enemy::update(float delta) {
	sprite->update(delta);
	sprite->setPos(x, y);
	if (health <= 0) {
		REMOVE = true;
	}
	// update enemy movement
	move(delta);
	// update movement direction when timer is up
	if (moveTime > 0.7f) {
		moveTime = 0.0f;
		currentDir = rand() % 4;
	}
	else moveTime += delta;
	// update the collision rectangle as well
	collisionBox->x = x;
	collisionBox->y = y;
}
```
And here's what the new header file contains:
```c++
class Enemy : public Creature {

public:

	Enemy();
	Enemy(int, int);
	virtual ~Enemy() {};

	// getter/setter methods
	void setCollisionMap(std::vector<int>);
	void setLevelWidth(int);
	void setTileSize(int);
	void setCollisionData(std::vector<int>, int, int);

	void update(float);
	void render(SDL_Surface*, SDL_Rect);
private:
	void init();

	// movement related variables/functions
	void move(float);
	bool checkCollision(int, int);
	int currentDir;	// 0 - Up, 1 - Right, 2 - Down, 3 - Left
	float moveTime;
	std::vector<int> collisionMap;
	int levelWidth, tileSize;

	int speed;
};
```
Note that the *move* and *checkCollision* function works the exact same way as the hero class.

## Making code better

### Static collision map data

So far, a lot of the code has been hacked together and as a result it looks quite messy and consists of many bad solutions. The first one I decided to fix was the one I just made, enemy collisions. How it works so far is that each enemy that is created, a copy of the collision map is stored in each enemy class. This results in a lot of storage space being wasted, since they are all storing the same thing. The simplest fix is to just use a static variable for the collision attributes of the enemy, so that only 1 copy is needed across each enemy. What's even better is that every enemy we add later on can use these static variables if they inherit the *Enemy* class, further saving storage space. Here's the new code:
```c++
// header file of Enemy class
class Enemy : public Creature {
public:
	Enemy();
	Enemy(int, int);
	virtual ~Enemy() {};
	// getter/setter methods
	static void setCollisionMap(std::vector<int>);
	static void setLevelWidth(int);
	static void setTileSize(int);
	static void setCollisionData(std::vector<int>, int, int);

	void update(float);
	void render(SDL_Surface*, SDL_Rect);
private:
	void init();
	// movement related variables/functions
	void move(float);
	bool checkCollision(int, int);
	int currentDir;	// 0 - Up, 1 - Right, 2 - Down, 3 - Left
	float moveTime;
	static std::vector<int> collisionMap;
	static int levelWidth, tileSize;
	int speed;
};
```
One mistake that took me a while to figure out was that I had to define the static variables at the top of the cpp file. I hadn't worked with static variables a lot before, so I didn't realize that declarations of static members in the class declaration weren't definitions of them. For a long time, I kept getting an *unresolved external symbol* error and couldn't figure out why, and then stackoverflow pointed out that I should add the definitions at the top of the file:
```c++
// define the static variables of the header file
std::vector<int> Enemy::collisionMap;
int Enemy::levelWidth, Enemy::tileSize;
```

### Const keyword

A lot of the classes were kind of rushed through, so I didn't have time to carefully review my code. I wrote quite a few getter methods but didn't put a **const** keyword with them. Although it doesn't directly impact my code, it does make it more prone to bugs in the future. By adding const, functions won't be able to change variable data that shouldn't be changed, which can prevent accidental bugs created from future code. The code is quite self explanitory, so I'm gonna skip posting it here.

## More constants

This change is even smaller than before but makes the code a bit easier to refactor if I decide to put some default/constant variables together in a file in the future. All I did was change the hard coded values in main file to use const variables. Here's what it looks like:
```c++
const int STARTING_WIDTH = 1280;
const int STARTING_HEIGHT = 720;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]){

    Engine game(STARTING_WIDTH, STARTING_HEIGHT);
    // other engine stuff...

    return 0;

}
```
Note that I use const for the variables even though I plan on being able to change window size in the future because these numbers merely represent the starting window size. When I change window size in the future, the changes will happen on variables inside the engine class and have nothing to do with the main class. The function of the main class is just to initialize the engine and run it, so anything else will not matter once we have initialized the engine.

## Improving movement

With the way I had implemented movement earlier, the enemies moved on a set interval which was quite unnatural. I made a few changes to how the enemy movement works and made it a bit more random. First of all, I removed the moveTimer that would tell the enemy when to change directions and added an idle functionality where the enemy would randomly stop to idle. To make things even smoother, I added logic to the move function where the enemy would change directions if they hit a wall. Here's what the new code looks like:
```c++
// The Update Function
void Enemy::update(float delta) {
	// sprite updating and stuff...
	// update enemy movement
	if (idleTimer > 0.0f) {
		idleTimer -= delta;
		if (idleTimer < 0.0f) idleTimer = 0.0f;
	}
	else {
		move(delta);
		int key = rand() % 200;
		if (key == 5) {
			idleTimer = 1.5f;
			currentDir = rand() % 4;
		}
	}
	// update collisions...
}

// The Movement Function
void Enemy::move(float delta) {
	// move the enemy according to the current direction...
	// if a collision occured, move by 1 pixel until collision again
	if (checkCollision(newX, newY)) {
		int lastX = newX = x;
		int lastY = newY = y;
		while (!checkCollision(newX, newY)) {
			lastX = newX;
			lastY = newY;
			if (currentDir == 0) { newY -= 1; }
			else if (currentDir == 1) { newX += 1; }
			else if (currentDir == 2) { newY += 1; }
			else if (currentDir == 3) { newX -= 1; }
		}
		x = lastX;
		y = lastY;
		// update the current direction so the enemy doesn't collide with a wall anymore
		int nextDir = rand() % 4;
		while (nextDir == currentDir) {
			nextDir = rand() % 4;
		}
		currentDir = nextDir;
	}
	else {
		// otherwise, set the new x and y positions
		x = newX;
		y = newY;
	}
}
```

## Adding another skill

So the game is pretty boring with only 1 skill to play with, so I added a dashing mechanic to it. However, my code is pretty poorly structured so I had to work around a lot of things. To implement the dash skill, I added a timer that would activate whenever a specific key is pressed, and if the timer is active then the update function will behave differently to execute the dash skill. This is the block of code added to the update function:
```c++
// update the dash timer if it isn't 0
if (dashTimer > 0.0f) {
	dashTimer -= delta;
	if (dashTimer <= 0.0f) {
		dashing = false;
		dashTimer = 0.0f;
	}
}
// update movement if the hero is dashing
if (dashing) {
	int distance = delta / 0.2f * dashDistance;
	if (dashDirection == 0 || dashDirection == 2) {
		int newY = (dashDirection == 0 ? -distance : distance) + y;
		// if a collision occured, move by 1 pixel until collision again
		if (checkCollision(x, newY)) {
			int lastY = newY = y;
			while (!checkCollision(x, newY)) {
				lastY = newY;
				newY += dashDirection == 0 ? -1 : 1;
			}
			y = lastY;
		}
		else { y = newY; }
	}
	else {
		// mirror above code with the other directions...
	}
}
 ```
 The code is quite similar to the movement code, but for the sake of time I just made another function for it. The code above is the logic code for when a hero is dashing, and below is the code that activates the dashing for the hero:
 ```c++
void Hero::key2Attack(int direction) {
	dashing = true;
	dashTimer = 0.2f;
	dashDirection = direction;
}
```
And that's pretty much all there is to it. It's actually quite simple, and the logic isn't as complicated as I thought it would have to be.

## More code improvements

The project is getting to the point where it is tedious to look for specific variables across the project to make small tweaks to values. The best solution is to just use a header containing all the constants, which is excactly what I did. Here's my *constants.h* file:
```c++
#pragma once

int const WINDOW_WIDTH = 1280;
int const WINDOW_HEIGHT = 720;

namespace HERO {
	int const BASE_SPEED = 300;
	int const DASH_DISTANCE = 400;
	float const ATTACK_1_TIME = 0.3f;
	float const ATTACK_2_TIME = 0.2f;
	int const COLLISION_SPRITE_MARGIN_X = 4;
	int const COLLISION_SPRITE_MARGIN_Y = 4;
	int const ATTACK_1_WIDTH = 100;
	int const ATTACK_1_HEIGHT = 64;
}
```
Then, I just included the header file into other files that needed them and switched some variable names around. So from now on, if I need to change a constant I don't have to look through a lot of different files to find them, I just look in the header file and change whatever I need.

Another flaw I noticed is that the movement code for the hero and enemy is basically the same, yet they were still two separate functions. To fix this, I moved some collision logic and movement code into the creature class so that any subclass can use the same movement function. I tried using static variables but they kept crashing my game and I couldn't figure out why, so I'll have to figure that out some other day.

### I will pull my hair out

So I finally figured out why I couldn't get static variables to work and I must say I am pretty damn stupid. The crash wasn't happening because I was handling static variables wrong, it was crashing because I was setting the variables before I initialized the map. This meant the map pointer I was calling from is actually a *nullptr* value, which is why the program was crashing.

### I really will pull my hair out

I wanted to try to put all the cooldown logic into the hero class so that it would be easier to have custom cooldowns across each different hero in the future. However, I accidentally put a lot of my animation logic to rely on the cooldown logic, which means if I were to take the cooldowns away from the player class the animations would come crashing down. My solution for now is to just add a function in the hero class that retrieves the cooldowns for each skill, meaning that future classes could just use the same function to have their own cooldowns. This, however, puts some constraints on customizability if I ever want to do anything more different, since all attacks have to follow the same logic with animations etc.. I can't really think of a way to do this well without tearing my previous code apart though, so I'll just stick with it for now..

### I want to punch my old self in the face

I just found a bug where I accidentally used the width input for both the width and the height in the Rectangle struct and it took me hours to find cause I kept thinking the problem was in the creature class.

### Just more code revisions

I was about to implement animations for the dashing attack when I realized having all animation logic in the player class wouldn't work for the future if I wanted to make different hero types, because animations might work differently for other heroes. This is when I had to take some time to put animations into the hero class instead, and boy did that take a while. I won't bother putting details into text description here but it did take some working around, I'll post the link to the commit [here](https://github.com/ianw3214/HeavensEdge/commit/fec499fd9026dca3f69939f0c6e002fd952e89bf)

## Adding animations to dashing

Adding animation to dashing was pretty easy now that most of the infrastructure was in place. All I really had to do was copy the animation code from the first attack over to dashing and *BOOM, DONE*. Here's what the final attack 2 code looks like:
```c++
void Hero::key2Attack() {
	if (dashing || attacking) return;
	dashing = true;
	dashTimer = 0.2f;
	if (*upPress) dashDirection = 0;
	else if (*rightPress) dashDirection = 1;
	else if (*downPress) dashDirection = 2;
	else if (*leftPress) dashDirection = 3;
	else dashDirection = faceRight ? 1 : 3;
	// update animations
	animState = faceRight ? DASH_RIGHT : DASH_LEFT;
	setNextAnimation(faceRight ? IDLE_RIGHT : IDLE_LEFT);
	playAnimation(animState);
	resetAnimationFrame();
}
```

## Thoughts and Grapes

So I'm quite happy that I decided to take a step back and clean up the structure of the code a bit, *your welcome future me!!* I have some ideas about what features I want to start working on next and I think I'm at a point where I can actually start working on the **meat** of the game! I don't know what else to say so I'll put down a bunch of smiley faces :D :D :D :D :D
