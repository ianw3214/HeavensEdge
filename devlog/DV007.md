## Basic Enemy AI

So far, enemies have been temporary orange squares that just stand there, which is really boring. That's why I decided to make them moving orange squares, just to spice things up a bit. I started out with a simple AI, to just have an enemy that moves around randomly. To do this, I gave the enemies a movement timer that tells the game when to change the direction of enemies, and move the enemy in the specified direction every update. With this, I had to add the collision data of the map into the enemy class, so that the enemies wouldn't walk into walls. The collision functions are the same as for the hero class, which means I'll have to refactor that somehow in the future. Here's the new update function for the enemy:
```c++
void Enemy::update(float delta) {
	sprite->update(delta);
	sprite->setPos(x, y);
	if (health <= 0) {
		REMOVE = true;
	}
	// update enemy movement
	move(delta);
	// update movement direction when timer is up
	if (moveTime > 0.7f) {
		moveTime = 0.0f;
		currentDir = rand() % 4;
	}
	else moveTime += delta;
	// update the collision rectangle as well
	collisionBox->x = x;
	collisionBox->y = y;
}
```
And here's what the new header file contains:
```c++
class Enemy : public Creature {

public:

	Enemy();
	Enemy(int, int);
	virtual ~Enemy() {};

	// getter/setter methods
	void setCollisionMap(std::vector<int>);
	void setLevelWidth(int);
	void setTileSize(int);
	void setCollisionData(std::vector<int>, int, int);

	void update(float);
	void render(SDL_Surface*, SDL_Rect);
private:
	void init();

	// movement related variables/functions
	void move(float);
	bool checkCollision(int, int);
	int currentDir;	// 0 - Up, 1 - Right, 2 - Down, 3 - Left
	float moveTime;
	std::vector<int> collisionMap;
	int levelWidth, tileSize;

	int speed;
};
```
Note that the *move* and *checkCollision* function works the exact same way as the hero class.

## Making code better

### Static collision map data

So far, a lot of the code has been hacked together and as a result it looks quite messy and consists of many bad solutions. The first one I decided to fix was the one I just made, enemy collisions. How it works so far is that each enemy that is created, a copy of the collision map is stored in each enemy class. This results in a lot of storage space being wasted, since they are all storing the same thing. The simplest fix is to just use a static variable for the collision attributes of the enemy, so that only 1 copy is needed across each enemy. What's even better is that every enemy we add later on can use these static variables if they inherit the *Enemy* class, further saving storage space. Here's the new code:
```c++
// header file of Enemy class
class Enemy : public Creature {
public:
	Enemy();
	Enemy(int, int);
	virtual ~Enemy() {};
	// getter/setter methods
	static void setCollisionMap(std::vector<int>);
	static void setLevelWidth(int);
	static void setTileSize(int);
	static void setCollisionData(std::vector<int>, int, int);

	void update(float);
	void render(SDL_Surface*, SDL_Rect);
private:
	void init();
	// movement related variables/functions
	void move(float);
	bool checkCollision(int, int);
	int currentDir;	// 0 - Up, 1 - Right, 2 - Down, 3 - Left
	float moveTime;
	static std::vector<int> collisionMap;
	static int levelWidth, tileSize;
	int speed;
};
```
One mistake that took me a while to figure out was that I had to define the static variables at the top of the cpp file. I hadn't worked with static variables a lot before, so I didn't realize that declarations of static members in the class declaration weren't definitions of them. For a long time, I kept getting an *unresolved external symbol* error and couldn't figure out why, and then stackoverflow pointed out that I should add the definitions at the top of the file:
```c++
// define the static variables of the header file
std::vector<int> Enemy::collisionMap;
int Enemy::levelWidth, Enemy::tileSize;
```

### Const keyword

A lot of the classes were kind of rushed through, so I didn't have time to carefully review my code. I wrote quite a few getter methods but didn't put a **const** keyword with them. Although it doesn't directly impact my code, it does make it more prone to bugs in the future. By adding const, functions won't be able to change variable data that shouldn't be changed, which can prevent accidental bugs created from future code. The code is quite self explanitory, so I'm gonna skip posting it here.

## More constants

This change is even smaller than before but makes the code a bit easier to refactor if I decide to put some default/constant variables together in a file in the future. All I did was change the hard coded values in main file to use const variables. Here's what it looks like:
```c++
const int STARTING_WIDTH = 1280;
const int STARTING_HEIGHT = 720;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]){

    Engine game(STARTING_WIDTH, STARTING_HEIGHT);
    // other engine stuff...

    return 0;

}
```
Note that I use const for the variables even though I plan on being able to change window size in the future because these numbers merely represent the starting window size. When I change window size in the future, the changes will happen on variables inside the engine class and have nothing to do with the main class. The function of the main class is just to initialize the engine and run it, so anything else will not matter once we have initialized the engine.
