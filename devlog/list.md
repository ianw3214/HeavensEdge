# The Plan

After spending the whole week trying to come up with art assets and not really touching a single piece of code, I have decided that this project has way too big of a scope and is not a reasonable size for me to take on alone. I thought I was able to make a small game when I begun but I didn't take into account the particle effects, animations, UI work, and just enormous amounts of different assets I would need to complete the game. On top of that, I don't have a lot of experience making pixel art which just slows me down even more, which then led me to my decision now.

Of course, I learned a lot throughout making this game. From making the level editor, making a sprite loading system, and other many different technical feats in the game I definitely learned a lot about game programming as well as engine programming. I have also learned my lesson about scope and making sure I don't bite off more than I can chew. To be honest, I really want to continue making this game but I just can't put that much effort into making assets because I don't have that kind of time during my university schedule. Perhaps one day in the far, far future I will pick up the project again.

For now, I will stick to making smaller scoped games, focusing on learning new techniques while making games. Starting next month, I will start doing [1 game a month](http://www.onegameamonth.com/) challenges, which hopefully will give me a good sense on the scope of a project vs. the time it takes to complete. I'm also thinking of starting a blog to post weekly updates on, which will help keep me on top of my work (I hope). Anyways, I haven't exactly thought all of this through yet but I have decided to stop working on this game, so goodbye I guess ( but the happy kind because there are better things to come! :D)
