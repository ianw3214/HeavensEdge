After an eternity of struggling with the Visual Studio command line tools (*that's an exaggeration if you didn't notice*), I was finally able compile a hello world program while linking to the glfw libraries. First I had to create a shell file that I would call every time I started up my workspace, so that I could call the 'vcvarsall' batch file from Visual Studio to use its' command line tools. My shell file looks like this:
```
@echo off
doskey a = atom $*
doskey ls = dir $*
doskey tx = pdflatex $*
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall"
cd "C:\Users\ianw3214\workspace\HeavensEdge"
atom .
echo on
```
I set some macros to commands I like to use, and then call the vcvarsall file to start the command line tools. My workspace file tree looks something like this:

Project Folder:  
  - art : any assets for the game goes here
  - build : compiled code and executables go here
  - libs : external libraries like glfw go here
  - src : source code goes here

On top of that, I set some useful batch files to help with compiling and debugging.

**Build.bat**: compiles my source code in the build folder to avoid cluttering up the folder containing source code. Note that opengl32.lib is included in visual studio, so there is no need to link it seperately. It took me hell of a long time to figure out that I had to link glfw3dll.lib though, so I was stuck on making the build.bat for quite a while.
```
@echo off
pushd ..\build
cl ..\src\main.cpp opengl32.lib /I C:\Users\ianw3214\workspace\HeavensEdge\libs\glfw-3.2.1.bin.WIN32\include /link C:\Users\ianw3214\workspace\HeavensEdge\libs\glfw-3.2.1.bin.WIN32\lib-vc2015\glfw3.lib C:\Users\ianw3214\workspace\HeavensEdge\libs\glfw-3.2.1.bin.WIN32\lib-vc2015\glfw3dll.lib /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE
popd
echo on

```

**Debug.bat**: calls the executable in visual studio to use the debugging tools
```
@echo off
pushd ..\build
devenv main.exe
popd
```

**Run.bat**: because I'm too lazy to change directories
```
@echo off
pushd ..\build
main.exe
popd
echo on
```

## Actual Code

After setting up my workspace, we finally get to some good old code!

Always include the header:
```c++
#define GLFW_DLL
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
```

First, we call the glfw initialization function:
```c++
// initialize GLFW
if(glfwInit()){
    // do stuff here
}
```

Then, we create the game window:
```c++
// window is in openGL context by default
GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(1280, 720, "game", nullptr, nullptr);
if(!window){
    glfwTerminate();
}
```
If the window wasn't created, the function will return a value of NULL, so we check for that before we start any other code.

Then, we destroy the window and terminate glfw at the end.
```c++
// destroy the window once the program finishes
// window destruction always succeeds, no need to check
glfwDestroyWindow(window);

// terminate GLFW
// also destroys any remaining open windows
glfwTerminate();
```
Note that it isn't actually necessary to call glfwDestroyWindow, since glfwTerminate will destroy any remaining windows for us anyways.

At this point, the program will compile and create a window for a split second and stop running. To keep the window running, I created a simple infinite loop with a boolean to keep track of whether the application should keep running. Once we set the boolean to false, the loop will exit and the window will close.
```c++
while(running){
    // check if the user exited the window
    if(glfwWindowShouldClose(window)){
        running = false;
    }
    glfwPollEvents();
}
```
Note that the glfwWindowShouldClose function returns true literally when the window should be closed, so when the X at the top right is pressed or if the user presses alt+f4 or kills the with a hatchet etc... We are simply checking if any of these events occur and kill the while loop if they do.

The final code looks like this:
```c++
#define GLFW_DLL
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>

#include <iostream>

// this function is called every time an error is encountered
void error_callback(int error, const char* description){
    std::cout << "Error: " << description << std::endl;
}

int main(void){

    bool running = true;

    // initialize GLFW
    if(glfwInit()){
        // set the error callback function that is called whenever an error occurs
        glfwSetErrorCallback(error_callback);
        // set a minimum required version of openGL
        glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR, 3);
        // create a window if GLFW was successfully initialized
        // window is in openGL context by default
        GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(1280, 720, "game", nullptr, nullptr);
        // make sure a window was successfully created before starting the game
        if(!window){
            glfwTerminate();
            running = false;
        }
        while(running){
            // check if the user exited the window
            if(glfwWindowShouldClose(window)){
                running = false;
            }
            glfwPollEvents();
        }
        // destroy the window once the program finishes
        // window destruction always succeeds, no need to check
        glfwDestroyWindow(window);

        // terminate GLFW
        // also destroys any remaining open windows
        glfwTerminate();
    }

    return 0;

}
```

## Some stuff

Because I am still learning openGL, these devlogs seem to be more about openGL than the game itself. Fear not, my friends. With time, as my openGL skills mature, the devlogs will mature along with it.

I still don't really know what kind of game I will be making, so I am open to suggestions. However, I doubt anyone will read this, so I'll just go cry in a corner while I come up with some ideas.
