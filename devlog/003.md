# Devlog 003

***

Today, I'm trying to take everything I did in the last 2 days and rebuild it again. Hopefully it will help me better understand how openGL works and how to go about creating a game in openGL.

***

First, the include and define statements.
```c++
#define GLFW_DLL
#include <glew.h>
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
```
We define **GLFW_DLL** to tell windows that GLFW functions are defined in a DLL, and it is required on windows when using GLFW. Then, we just include the two libraries we are using, glew to help load openGL functions and extensions and GLFW to help window management.

Then, we call **glfwInit** to initialize the GLFW library. The function will return *GLFW_FALSE* if something goes wrong.
```c++
if(glfwInit()){
    // do something here
}else{
    // something went wrong
}
```

We also want to set an error callback function to be run every time an error occurs.
```c++
void error_callback(int error, const char* description){
    std::cout << "Error: " << description << std::endl;
}

...

glfwSetErrorCallback(error_callback);
```

We can then use GLFW to create a window. First, we use the **glfwWindowHint** function to set a minimum required version of openGL. Then, we create a window of the **GLFWwindow** type and check if the window was successfully created. Also set the current context to the new window if it was successfully created.  
[GLFW window reference](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__window.html)
```c++
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR, 3);
GLFWwindow * window = glfwCreateWindow(1280, 720, "game", nullptr, nullptr);
if(!window){
    // handle window creation error
}else{
    glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);
}
```

Next, we initialize GLEW to help with loading openGL functions and extensions.
```c++
glewExperimental = GL_TRUE;
GLenum err = glewInit();
if(GLEW_OK != err){
    std::cout << glewGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
}
```

After that, we can set up a main loop that will update the program consistently until the user closes the window. Using the **glfwWindowShouldClose** function, we can set the loop to quit when the user closes the application somehow. We use the **glfwPollEvents** get any input from the user, including the application quit events.

```c++
// we set up a boolean to check if the application should quit every cycle
// main loop
while(running){
    if(glfwWindowShouldClose(window)){
        running = false;
    }
    glfwPollEvents();
}
```

Finally, we close all the resources when we are done.
```c++
glfwDestroyWindow(window);
glfwTerminate();
```

## Drawing a shape... again.

Since I got really confused last time about whatever I was doing, I'm gonna try to dive deeper this time and actually understand what I'm doing.

A **Vertex array object** is an object in which data about 3D models are stored. They hold 'slots' to store data known as attribute *attribute lists*. Each list stores a different type of data for the vertices, for example, one list might store the vertex positions and another might store the vertex colours. The attributes in each list are stored as **Vertex Buffer Objects**, which is just data similar to an array of numbers. They can store different kinds of information as well, like vertex positions, colors, or normals.

Vertex Array Object(VAO):

|index|VBO|
|---|---|
|0|Vertex Buffer Object 1|
|1|Vertex Buffer Object 2|
|2|Vertex Buffer Object 3|
|...|...|

Each VAO has it's own ID, which allows us to access it's data when it's stored in memory. When we want to render a shape, we can tell openGL the ID of the VAO and have it render whatever data is in it.

In general, creating objects in openGL is very different from normal programming. Instead of declaring an object and assigning it some value, we create a **GLuint** unsigned integer which will hold the ID for our objects, and then call an openGL function to change its state.  
In general, it will look something like this:
```c++
GLfloat ID;
glGenObject(numberOfObjects, ID);
```

Before working with a VBO or VAO, we have to first bind them with the functions **glBindVertexArray(VAO)** or **glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, VBO)**. We can store vertex data in buffer objects using *GLfloat* arrays, and passing them into the **glBufferData** function.
```c++
GLfloat[] vertices = {
    // vertex float data here...
};
// the GL_STATIC_DRAW parameter says that the stored data won't be modified
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertices), vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
```
