### Devlog 002

***

This week, I was able to implement some of the basic features of the game engine. First, I'll start off by explaining the sprite class.

***

## Sprites

The sprite class will be the base class for many other classes, like enemies and players etc. Therefore, we have to set the methods of the class to be virtual so that the redefined methods in the sub classes will be called even when stored as a Sprite class. Here's a look at the sprite header.

```c++
// includes here
class Sprite{

public:
    Sprite(std::string);
    Sprite(std::string, int, int);
    Sprite(std::string, int, int, int, int);

    virtual int getX() const;
    virtual int getY() const;
    virtual void setPos(int, int);
    virtual SDL_Rect getCollisionRect() const;
    virtual void setCollisionWidth(int);
    virtual void setCollisionHeight(int);
    virtual void setCollisionRect(int, int);
    virtual void changeSpriteSheet(std::string path);

    virtual void update(float);
    virtual void render(SDL_Surface*, SDL_Rect);
protected:
    SDL_Surface * img;

    int x, y;
    int collisionWidth, collisionHeight;
    SDL_Rect collisionRect;

    bool REMOVE;
private:
    void init(int x, int y, int w, int h);
    void loadImage(std::string);
};
```

As you can see, the bulk of the methods of the class are virtual functions. Also notice that there are multiple constructors, which really isn't necessary but might make things easier down the road so I can do sprite initialization in single lines to make things look cleaner. The getter functions really don't need to be virtual, but I made them virtual anyways for consistency and in case I want to change something down the rode.

The *x* and *y* variables represent the position of the sprite on the absolute grid and not the screen, meaning that the render function has to take into account the camera position before rendering the sprite onto the screen. The final rendering coordinates are calculated by simply subtracting the absolute position by the camera position. Here's what the render function looks like.

```c++
void Sprite::render(SDL_Surface * display, SDL_Rect camera){
    SDL_Rect targetRect = {x - camera.x, y - camera.y, 0, 0};
    if(SDL_BlitSurface(img, nullptr, display, &targetRect) < 0){
        // error message here
    }
}
```

Most of the other code in the sprite class is self explanitory, and the update function doesn't do anything in the base Sprite class. It is simply there so that sub classes can still call the update function if they need to.

Also, note that sprites have a **REMOVE** boolean attribute, which allows the class using the sprite to determine if the sprite should be deleted. The class would simply loop through all sprites and check which one have the *REMOVE* variable set to true, and if it is then it would remove that sprite.

***

## Animated Sprites

The animated sprite class is the first subclass of Sprite. It stores animation sequences in a vector, and for now I am just making it so that each animation is on one line in the image. For example, a player class might have 3 frames of idle animation on the first row of the image file, then a 4 frame animation for running right on the second row, and so on. This makes it easier to program, because I can use the index of the vector to correspond to which animation I am playing. In the animated sprite class, the **currentAnim** integer keeps track of which row I am currently using to play the animation.

Most of the variables are self explanitory as well, like tileWidth, currentFrame, etc. I added an boolean option in the constructor called **shouldPlayOnce**, which allows the option of having the sprite be deleted after it plays its animation frame. Heres the code for the update function.

```c++
void AnimatedSprite::update(float delta){
    deltaTime += delta;
    // update the sprite every 1/3 seconds
    if(deltaTime >= 0.33f){
        // after the 1/3 seconds is reached, go to the next frame
        currentFrame++;
        // if the current frame is bigger than the total number of frames,
        // reset the animation
        if(currentFrame >= animData.at(currentAnim)){
            // if the animation reached the end and should only be played once,
            // remove the sprite
            if(playOnce) REMOVE = true;
            currentFrame = 0;
        }
        // reset the deltaTime and recalculate the rect to blit from on
        // the sprite sheet
        deltaTime = 0.0f;
        updateBlitRect();
    }
}
```

***

## Game state

The game state class is the base of all game states such as menus, gameplay, options, loading screens, etc. It is essentially an interface for other classes to follow so that the engine can work with all different game states. Heres what the header file looks like.

```c++
// includes here
class State{

public:
    State();

    virtual void init();
    virtual void exit();

    virtual void handleEvents();
    virtual void update(float);
    virtual void render(SDL_Surface*);

    bool shouldQuit();
    State* getNextState();
private:
    State * nextState;
    bool quit;
};
```
Note that most methods are virtual methods, just like the base sprite class. In the c++ file, most methods have empty definitions. To be honest, the state class should be an abstract class, I just couldn't do it cause I was using using the base state class to test a lot of other functions so I needed to instantiate it.

Also, I added some changes in the engine class to work with the game state system. The engine class now has a **currentState** variable which holds the current running state, and the engine calls the functions of the state class every loop. The engine also takes in a *State* object in its' parameter as well, so that the engine can start with a state instead of just being an empty engine. Lastly, I added a check to the engine update code so that it checks if the state is saying that the game should quit, using the  **shouldQuit** method from the State class. If the method returns true, then the engine tells the main code to quit and the game loop stops.

***

## Tiles and TileMaps

Ah, the classic tile system. Before I start saying anything, I will show my Tile header file.
```c++
// includes here
class Tile{
public:
    Tile(std::string, int, int, int, int);

    virtual void update();
    virtual void render(SDL_Surface*, int, int);
protected:
    int tileWidth, tileHeight;

    SDL_Surface * spriteSheet;
    SDL_Rect blitRect;
};
```
Essentially, the tile just takes in a file path and loads the image, and then it figures out which part of the image is the tile it should represent from the integers that is passed into its' constructor. The update function is empty and I put it in so that if I decide to make animated tiles, I could just call it all from a single Tile container. The **render** function, unlike the *Sprite* render function, takes in the absolute *x* and *y* position because it assumes that the class handling the tile already calculated where the tile should be rendered. The render function looks like this.
```c++
void Tile::render(SDL_Surface* display, int x, int y){
    SDL_Rect targetRect = {x, y, 0, 0};
    if(SDL_BlitSurface(spriteSheet, &blitRect, display, &targetRect) < 0){
        std::cout << "Image unable to blit, error: " << SDL_GetError() << std::endl;
    }
}
```

After the tile class, we move on to the map class. This is where the fun part is :D Before I explain anything, I'll show my header file again.
```c++
// include things
class Map{
public:
    Map();
    Map(std::string);

    // todo: implement loading tile map keys from a file/external class
    bool loadFromFile(std::string);

    void update();
    void render(SDL_Surface*, SDL_Rect);
private:
    int mapWidth, mapHeight;
    int tileWidth, tileHeight;

    std::map<int, Tile*> tileMap;
    std::vector<int> mapData;

    void lineToTileMap(std::string);
    void lineToMapData(std::string);
};
```

First, you might notice that I'm using a STL map. I know some people say that I should code my own data structures so it can be more effecient blah blah blah, but for right now it's the easiest solution and I doubt that the game is going to get large enough for this to be an issue.

With that out of the way, lets start with the *render* function. The function first calculates the starting and ending coordinates of the camera, so that it knows which tiles are in range of the screen and should be rendered. The tile data is stored as integers in a *vector*. I loop through the vector and calculate the absolute X and Y position of each tile, and then compare that to the position of the camera. If the tile is shown on screen, I then render the tile by looking up a **map** for the Tile corresponding to the current integer key. Here's the render function of the map.
```c++
// variables used to calculate whether a tile is on screen and should be rendered
int startX = camera.x;
int startY = camera.y;
int endX = camera.x + camera.w;
int endY = camera.y + camera.h;

// loop through each tile and render them
int tileX, tileY;
for(unsigned int i = 0; i < mapData.size(); i++){
    // calculate the absolute x and y position according to tile position
    tileX = (i % mapWidth) * tileWidth;
    tileY = (static_cast<int>(i/mapWidth)) * tileHeight;
    // check to see if tile is on screen
    if(tileX >= startX-tileWidth && tileY >= startY-tileHeight && tileX <= endX && tileY <= endY){
        // get the integer key at the current tile position
        int key = mapData.at(i);
        // find the tile corresponding to the key and render it
        if(!(tileMap.find(key) == tileMap.end())){
            tileMap[key]->render(display, tileX - camera.x, tileY - camera.y);
        }
    }
}
```

A **map** structure is essentially a bunch of key-value pairs. Kind of like a JSON data type, except the keys can only be a single type and the values can only be a single type. In my case, I use a *map* of integers to tile pointers. To be honest, I'm not too sure why I use pointers, but I think they work better and I definetly need to figure out if it is better or not.

***

## Map loading from file

The map data is all stored in a text file. Before I continue, I will show you what the text file looks like.
```
64
64

0#assets/tiles.png#0#0
1#assets/tiles.png#1#0
---
0#0#0#0
0#1#0#1
0#0#0#1
1#1#1#1
```
The first 2 lines correspond to the tile width/height. The next 2 lines correspond to the map width/height. The lines after that are all data about tile map keys. It is stored in the format *index # file path # x position in image # y position in image*. When the program reads a *---* line, it knows that it is no longer reading tile key data and is starting to read the map data. For this part, I actually don't need to put things on separate lines, but it makes things easier for people to read. Everything is separated by # because why not. The map class has a **loadFromFile** function that takes a file path and loads a map based on the contents of the file. Heres the code.
```c++
std::ifstream fileStream;
fileStream.open(file);
std::string line;
int counter = 0;        // counter to keep track of which line we're reading
bool onMapData = false;
while(getline(fileStream, line)){
    if(counter == 0){   // first line is the width of each tile
        int width = std::stoi(line, nullptr);
        tileWidth = width;
    }
    if(counter == 1){   // second line is the height of each tile
        int height = std::stoi(line, nullptr);
        tileHeight = height;
    }
    if(counter == 2){   // third line is the width of each map in tiles
        int width = std::stoi(line, nullptr);
        mapWidth = width;
    }
    if(counter == 3){   // third line is the width of each map in tiles
        int height = std::stoi(line, nullptr);
        mapHeight = height;
    }
    if(onMapData){  // read the numbers into the map data
        lineToMapData(line);
    }
    if(line == "---"){  // stop reading into tile map when token is reached
        onMapData = true;
    }
    if(counter > 3 && !onMapData){  // reading tile info to tileMap
        lineToTileMap(line);
    }
    counter++;
}
```
Everything is hard coded right now and the order even matters, so that is something I have to look into in the future.

## Thoughts / The Future ???

Although I tried to modularize a lot of the code, it is still quite messy and there are a lot dependencies, which I will have to change. Also, the file loading doesn't work well with animated sprites right now, so that is something I have to look into in the future. For now though, I'm making some good progress and hopefully it'll lead to something magnificent, like a unicorn <3
