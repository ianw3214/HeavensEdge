## Entity Component Systems

So I've been starting to think about how I'm going to implement health and enemies. Naturally, the subject of *Entity Component Systems* comes up. If you don't know what that is, there are a bunch of great resources online that can explain it a lot better than I can.

However, after some good reading I've decided that I won't need to use them. The goal of the game is to have a lot of unique bosses/monsters that share very little logic/mechanics to each other, so using an ECS doesn't make sense because each component would be pretty much unique to an entity, so I might as well just put the code in the entity itself. However, if I find that I'm re-using a lot of code, I might use some mix of ECS in my own code to make things more readable and all that good stuff. In the end, I don't think my game will be large enough that I will have to worry about performance too much, so I'm just rolling with what I think of.

## Entity Class Rehaul

So I've been thinking a bit about how I'm going to implement health/attacks and I've decided to do some restructuring in my code. The way I have it set up now, entities will represent pretty much everything in the game. The way I'm going to change it is that **GameObjects** and **Entities** are going to be different classes, where Entity *inherits* from *Gameobjects*. The *GameObject* class will be the base class that represents everything in the game, from the map to players to particle effects to pretty much anything. The *Entity* class will represent *creatures*, basically anything that has health and attacks or something.

Before I jumped into the code, I started with a basic UML diagram. Keep in mind that I am no professional coder, so the UML may be very inconsistent, I'm not sure if it's even UML.

At this point, I'm not worrying about performance because I don't know if I'll get enough content/features in my game to have to worry about performance. If the game calls for it, then I will dive into optimizing things.

## Aftermath of Entity class Rehaul

So the actual code didn't really end up looking like my diagram. There are a few main structural things that had to change a lot.

### The sprite and animated Sprite class

Since GameObject and entity are now separated, sprites inherit from *GameObject* instead of *Entity*. The problem this creates, as we will see from my hero class, is that classes that want to inherit from *Entity* can't inherit from AnimatedSprite, or else I'll have to use **Multiple inheritance** and that adds too much complexity for me.

### The Hero class

So since *Hero* inherits from *Entity* now, I can't inherit from *AnimatedSprite* or else I'll have to deal with multiple inheritance, as explained above. My solution is to use *aggregation* / *composition* or whatever that's called. I'm not really good with the terms yet :/ Anyways, I essentially instantiate an *AnimatedSprite* and have a pointer to it in my *Hero* class. That way, whatever I animated sprite attribute I was using before I can just call on the new Animated Sprite object. For a more detailed look into the implementations, i'll link to the commit where I made the changes below.
