## Entity Component Systems

So I've been starting to think about how I'm going to implement health and enemies. Naturally, the subject of *Entity Component Systems* comes up. If you don't know what that is, there are a bunch of great resources online that can explain it a lot better than I can.

However, after some good reading I've decided that I won't need to use them. The goal of the game is to have a lot of unique bosses/monsters that share very little logic/mechanics to each other, so using an ECS doesn't make sense because each component would be pretty much unique to an entity, so I might as well just put the code in the entity itself. However, if I find that I'm re-using a lot of code, I might use some mix of ECS in my own code to make things more readable and all that good stuff. In the end, I don't think my game will be large enough that I will have to worry about performance too much, so I'm just rolling with what I think of.
