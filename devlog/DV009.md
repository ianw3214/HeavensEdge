## The Plan

So last week I set up a lot of the infrastructure to actually make the content of the game, specifically the level editor. I will hopefully start making a level; I want to finish at least one basic level with finished sprites/music. Before that though, there are still a few systems I want to set up first, namely NPCs. Once I finish designing the systems for NPCs, then I can really design a level that looks real. Here's a list of things I want to achieve this week.

* NPC system
* NPC loading from file
* enemy loading from file
* art/music for first level

As you can see, not too much planned for this week but each task is a bit heavier than usual so it will probably work out.
