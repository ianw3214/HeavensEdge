## The Plan

So last week I set up a lot of the infrastructure to actually make the content of the game, specifically the level editor. I will hopefully start making a level; I want to finish at least one basic level with finished sprites/music. Before that though, there are still a few systems I want to set up first, namely NPCs. Once I finish designing the systems for NPCs, then I can really design a level that looks real. Here's a list of things I want to achieve this week.

* NPC system
* NPC loading from file
* enemy loading from file
* art/music for first level

As you can see, not too much planned for this week but each task is a bit heavier than usual so it will probably work out.

## Implementing a basic NPC

So I have now implemented a basic NPC that will speak with the console! That's a start I guess. Also I have to stop starting these paragraphs with the word *so*. Anyways, the NPC system is quite simple, I don't plan on making it any more intricate because I don't want my game to be too revolved around the story/plot. I simply wanted to have NPCs to make the world seem more lively. I'm not going to put up the NPC code, it is basically built on top of the creature class but it has an extra attribute storing a vector of strings. The *kind of harder but not really* part was getting the interaction to work. Right now, the player just finds the first NPC in the vector to interact with but soon I will have to add range and distance comparing to make things seem more natural. Anyways, here's the code for handling the dialogue:
```c++
void Hero::handleDialogue() {
	if (inDialogue) {
		if (currentDialogue.size() <= dialogueIndex) {
			inDialogue = false;
			dialogueIndex = 0;
			currentDialogue = {};
		} else {
			std::cout << currentDialogue.at(dialogueIndex) << std::endl;
			dialogueIndex++;
		}
	} else {
		for (unsigned int i = 0; i < entityList->size(); i++) {
			if (entityList->at(i)->getType() == 4) {
				NPC * temp = dynamic_cast<NPC*>(entityList->at(i));
				currentDialogue = temp->getDialogue();
				break;
			}
		}
		// if the vector is empty, simply reset and exit
		if (currentDialogue.size() == 0) { return; }
		// otherwise, play the first line of the dialogue
		else if (currentDialogue.size() == 1) {
			std::cout << currentDialogue.at(0) << std::endl;
			currentDialogue = {};
		} else {
			inDialogue = true;
			std::cout << currentDialogue.at(0) << std::endl;
			dialogueIndex++;
		}
	}
}
```
So on the first interaction, the player will look for an NPC to get the dialogue of and print the first line of the dialogue if it exists. Then, on subsequent calls, the player will print the rest of the vector until there is nothing else to print, and then everything resets. Of course, This will eventually be words on the screen but for now, It is just console text being printed.

One more thing that I have to keep in mind is that I have to stop movement later while the player is in dialogue. It should be easy to implement but It's still something I have to do anyways.
