## The Plan

So last week I set up a lot of the infrastructure to actually make the content of the game, specifically the level editor. I will hopefully start making a level; I want to finish at least one basic level with finished sprites/music. Before that though, there are still a few systems I want to set up first, namely NPCs. Once I finish designing the systems for NPCs, then I can really design a level that looks real. Here's a list of things I want to achieve this week.

* NPC system
* NPC loading from file
* enemy loading from file
* art/music for first level

As you can see, not too much planned for this week but each task is a bit heavier than usual so it will probably work out.

## Implementing a basic NPC

So I have now implemented a basic NPC that will speak with the console! That's a start I guess. Also I have to stop starting these paragraphs with the word *so*. Anyways, the NPC system is quite simple, I don't plan on making it any more intricate because I don't want my game to be too revolved around the story/plot. I simply wanted to have NPCs to make the world seem more lively. I'm not going to put up the NPC code, it is basically built on top of the creature class but it has an extra attribute storing a vector of strings. The *kind of harder but not really* part was getting the interaction to work. Right now, the player just finds the first NPC in the vector to interact with but soon I will have to add range and distance comparing to make things seem more natural. Anyways, here's the code for handling the dialogue:
```c++
void Hero::handleDialogue() {
	if (inDialogue) {
		if (currentDialogue.size() <= dialogueIndex) {
			inDialogue = false;
			dialogueIndex = 0;
			currentDialogue = {};
		} else {
			std::cout << currentDialogue.at(dialogueIndex) << std::endl;
			dialogueIndex++;
		}
	} else {
		for (unsigned int i = 0; i < entityList->size(); i++) {
			if (entityList->at(i)->getType() == 4) {
				NPC * temp = dynamic_cast<NPC*>(entityList->at(i));
				currentDialogue = temp->getDialogue();
				break;
			}
		}
		// if the vector is empty, simply reset and exit
		if (currentDialogue.size() == 0) { return; }
		// otherwise, play the first line of the dialogue
		else if (currentDialogue.size() == 1) {
			std::cout << currentDialogue.at(0) << std::endl;
			currentDialogue = {};
		} else {
			inDialogue = true;
			std::cout << currentDialogue.at(0) << std::endl;
			dialogueIndex++;
		}
	}
}
```
So on the first interaction, the player will look for an NPC to get the dialogue of and print the first line of the dialogue if it exists. Then, on subsequent calls, the player will print the rest of the vector until there is nothing else to print, and then everything resets. Of course, This will eventually be words on the screen but for now, It is just console text being printed.

One more thing that I have to keep in mind is that I have to stop movement later while the player is in dialogue. It should be easy to implement but It's still something I have to do anyways.

***

## Circular Collisions

One thing I wanted to add was circles, but I could never justify adding them until now. Using squares to find if NPCs were within range just felt unnatural, so I used a circle to represent the range at which players could interact with an NPC. The new struct for Circle is quite easy, it is just 3 variables: *x*, *y*, and *r*, which stands for radius. The collision code isn't too hard either, it looks for the closest point of the rectangle to the circle and compares the distance to the radius and if it is too long then the objects aren't colliding. I didn't think of this myself, I found it on a [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/401847/circle-rectangle-collision-detection-intersection). Anyways, here's the collision code:
```c++
bool collisionCircleRect(const Circle& circle, const Rectangle& rect) {
	// find collision by finding shortest point and then comparing distance against radius
	int closestX = clamp(circle.x, rect.x, rect.x + rect.w);
	int closestY = clamp(circle.y, rect.y, rect.y + rect.h);
	int distanceX = circle.x - closestX;
	int distanceY = circle.y - closestY;
	float distanceSquared = (distanceX * distanceX) + (distanceY * distanceY);
	// if the distance is longer than the radius, the function will return false
	return distanceSquared < (circle.r * circle.r);
}
int clamp(int val, int min, int max) {
	if (val > max) return max;
	if (val < min) return min;
	return val;
}
```
The **clamp** function simply limits the *val* parameter to the range created by *[min..max]*. With this, I could update the dialogue code in the hero class to use the new collision code, here's the NPC searching function now:
```c++
void Hero::findNPCforDialogue() {
	for (unsigned int i = 0; i < entityList->size(); i++) {
		if (entityList->at(i)->getType() == 4) {
			NPC * temp = dynamic_cast<NPC*>(entityList->at(i));
			Circle range(x + 32, y + 32, 96);
			if (isColliding(range, *(temp->getCollisionBox()))) {
				currentDialogue = temp->getDialogue();
				break;
			}
		}
	}
	// do stuff...
}
```
Now I have to somehow find the closest NPC instead of just finding the first one in the vector. I have a pretty good idea of how I'm going to do that so I'll probably get that done soon.

***

## Nearest NPC

So with the current algorithm, the function just looks for the first NPC in the vector that is in range of the player. However, what we want is to look for the *nearest* NPC to the player. To do that, I calculate the distance from each NPC to the player and instead of breaking the for loop when we find an NPC, we compare the distance to the current minimum and if it is smaller then we set said NPC to be the new minimum. After the for loop ends, we then have the NPC with the smallest distance to the player. Here's what the function looks like now:
```c++
void Hero::findNPCforDialogue() {
	// variables for keeping track of the current nearest NPC
	float minDistance = -1.0;
	NPC * minNPC = nullptr;
	// loop through the entity list and look for the nearest NPC
	for (unsigned int i = 0; i < entityList->size(); i++) {
		if (entityList->at(i)->getType() == 4) {
			NPC * thisNPC = dynamic_cast<NPC*>(entityList->at(i));
			// make a circle for setting up the range
			Circle range(x + 32, y + 32, 96);
			if (isColliding(range, *(thisNPC->getCollisionBox()))) {
				// get the distance and compare it to the current smallest distance
				int xDistance = std::abs(thisNPC->getX() - x);
				int yDistance = std::abs(thisNPC->getY() - y);
				float distance = std::sqrt(xDistance * xDistance + yDistance * yDistance);
				// if the distance is smaller or if it is the first distance, set it to the NPC
				if (distance < minDistance || minDistance < 0.0f) {
					minDistance = distance;
					minNPC = thisNPC;
				}
			}
		}
	}
	// set up dialogue and stuff
}
```
Now that the NPC system is in place, I can start working on loading NPCs from files and including the NPC data in the map files as well.

## NPC loading from file

For now, I'm adding all the map data to the map data file so things can get done a bit faster. In the future, I want to put IDs onto NPCs and enemies so that I can just store IDs in a map data file and then load the actual entities from their corresponding IDs in the file. Anyways, I finished NPC loading in the map class, the actual structure in the file looks like:  
*x coord # y coord # asset path # dialogue 1 # dialogue 2 # ...*  
And here is what the actual loading function looks like:
```c++
void Map::lineToNPCData(std::string line) {
	std::string token = "";
	int counter = 0;
	// variables to hold the NPC data
	NPC * thisNPC = nullptr;
	int x, y;
	std::vector<std::string> dialogue;
	std::string path;
	for (char const & c : line) {
		if (c == '#') {
			if (counter == 0) {
				x = std::stoi(token, nullptr);
				x *= 64;
			}
			if (counter == 1) {
				y = std::stoi(token, nullptr);
				y *= 64;
			}
			if (counter == 2) {	path = token;}
			if (counter >= 3) {	dialogue.push_back(token); }
			// reset the token and increment the counter
			token = "";
			counter++;
		}
		else { token += c;	}
	}
	// if the counter >= 3, then we missed one last token
	if (counter >= 3) dialogue.push_back(token);
	thisNPC = new NPC(x, y, dialogue, path);
	NPCs.push_back(thisNPC);
	return;
}*
```
I'm not going to show what I changed in the actual reading from the file because I want to give that an overhaul soon. Right now, it depends heavily on the order the if statements are read in and it just seems too unstable for me.

With NPC loading done, I implemented NPC loading soon after. It is really similar to NPC loading, but instead of having dialogue right there I load enemies depending on an ID. One thing I might change is use the *factory pattern* to make my enemies instead of IDs, because right now I'm including all my enemy code into my Map class and that just seems awfully bloated. Anyways, if you are interested in how I implemented enemy loading then [here is the link](https://github.com/ianw3214/HeavensEdge/commit/cccf30148c4049c30dbd6ae3c4cfe1320c01d382).

## Switching to Renderers

I was trying to make some settings work with window resizing earlier when I came upon a horrible realization. I went on Stackoverflow and found out that using *surfaces* in SDL is pretty outdated and that I should use *renderers* now. That meant that I had to redo a lot of the code that I had already written. So, I just sat down and started working away. Now, I finally have the renderer system in place and almost everything is back to where it was. One big difference is that renderers require the right width and height for the sprites to render properly, whereas with surfaces before I could just use 0/0. This means I have to go back and recheck if the width and height are right for all the entities...*sigh*

On top of getting the renderer system in place, I put in an ID system for getting textures. This is useful because then I don't have to pass a Renderer in the constructor of every entity so that it can load the textures, the entities can just get the textures from a central function call. I did this by using a class with static variables/methods. Here's what the class looks like:
```c++
// includes herer...

class UTIL {
public:
	// initialization functions to be called in the engine
	static void loadTextures(SDL_Renderer*);
	static SDL_Texture * loadTexture(std::string, SDL_Renderer*);

	static SDL_Texture * getTextureFromId(std::string);
private:
	static std::map<std::string, SDL_Texture*> textureMap;
};
```
And here's the implementation of the code:
```c++
#include "util.h"
std::map<std::string, SDL_Texture*> UTIL::textureMap;
// initialization function to be called in engine
void UTIL::loadTextures(SDL_Renderer* renderer) {
	std::ifstream fileStream;
	fileStream.open(TEXTURE_ID_PATH);
	std::string line;
	while (getline(fileStream, line)) {
		std::string token = "";
		int counter = 0;
		std::string ID, path;
		for (char const & c : line) {
			if (c == '#') {
				ID = token;
				token = "";
			}
			else {
				token += c;
			}
		}
		path = token;
		// load the image from the path to a texture
		textureMap[ID] = loadTexture(path, renderer);
	}
}
SDL_Texture * UTIL::getTextureFromId(std::string ID) {
	return textureMap[ID];
}
SDL_Texture* UTIL::loadTexture(std::string path, SDL_Renderer * renderer) {
	// the final texture to return
	SDL_Texture * texture = NULL;
	// load the image onto a surface first
	SDL_Surface * loadedSurface = IMG_Load(path.c_str());
	if (loadedSurface == NULL) std::cout << "Unable to load image: " << path << ", ERROR: " << IMG_GetError() << std::endl;
	else {
		// create texture from surface pixels
		texture = SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface(renderer, loadedSurface);
		if (texture == NULL) std::cout << "Unable to create texture: " << path << ", ERROR: " << SDL_GetError() << std::endl;
		// get rid of the loaded surface
		SDL_FreeSurface(loadedSurface);
	}
	return texture;
}
```
With this, I just have to call the *getTextureFromId* function with an ID to get the corresponding Texture. However, I don't think this works too well with the *map* class so I will still have to work on that a bit. Also, I have to get the width/height things right for entities for them to actually show up.

## Setting window size

With the renderer in place, I decided to try setting a different window size first to see if everything would work. While it is not exactly *peachy*, the window does actual change size. Now I just have to change a bunch of things so that nothing is hard coded. Anyways, I achieved this by first setting the window to be a static *SDL_Window** variable in the UTIL class. Then, I just need 1 simple function call to make everything work.
```c++
SDL_SetWindowSize(UTIL::getWindow(), 720, 480);
```
And there it is, window size is now easily changed with the call of a single function. Of course, I will eventually do fullscreen/whatever other settings there are but for now this is good enough.

### Some fixes

I realized the width/height problem for the sprites was a really stupid thing that I overlooked so the solution was pretty simple. All I had to do to fix it was adjust the render function in animatedSprite because I accidentally passed nullptr into the renderCopy function. Also, I forgot to set *w* and *h* upon initialization so that probably did it too. Anyways, that's fixed now and the game is back to where it was before except with renderers!

### finishing touches with window size

My final solution was to just add more static variables to the UTIL class. I know, I know, this is bad practice because I'm essentially using the UTIL class to hold global variables and that can be bad; But I don't really have another practical solution at the moment so it'll have to do. Anyways, here's the new UTIL class header:
```c++
// includes...

class UTIL {
public:
	static void loadTextures(SDL_Renderer*);
	static SDL_Texture * loadTexture(std::string, SDL_Renderer*);
	static SDL_Texture * getTextureFromId(std::string);
	static void setWindow(SDL_Window*);
	static SDL_Window* getWindow();
	static void setWindowSize(int, int);
	static int getWindowWidth();
	static int getWindowHeight();
private:
	static std::map<std::string, SDL_Texture*> textureMap;
	static SDL_Window* gameWindow;
	static int screenWidth, screenHeight;
};
```
Then, in the level initialization, I just set the camera width and height to that of the screen by calling *getWindowWidth* and *getWindowHeight*. Everything else works smoothly because I wrote the code before to adjust itself according to the camera size so I now have a centered game no matter what the window size is!

## Tweaking the editor

So the editor is still in a pretty basic state, it can really only change tiles and collision maps. I decided to give it the ability to change the player spawn, because trying to figure it out and then change it manually would be a really big pain in the butt. First, I had to make a few changes to how the editor worked. Instead of having a boolean keep track of whether the editor is in collision mode, I used an integer to keep track of what mode the editor was in. This way, I could have multiple modes for the editor and not need a different boolean to keep track of them all. The code isn't too complicated, so I'll just show what goes on when the user performs a left click:
```c++
else if (editorMode == mode_player) {
	int x, y;
	SDL_GetMouseState(&x, &y);
	player_x = static_cast<int>((x - xOffset) / 64);
	player_y = static_cast<int>((y - yOffset) / 64);
}
```
The *player_x* and *player_y* methods keep track of where the player spawn is supposed to be, and passes it to the map saveFile function when saving the file. Then, I just render the player sprite depending on where the player spawn is set every update and then everything works!

## Multiple window sizes

So far, even though the game size changing is working, it only switches between two sizes. To add different sizes, I put all the desired ratios in a vector and store them as pairs. Then the menu just alternates between each pair using an index and gets the ratio from that. The implementation is pretty trivial so I'm leaving that out of this log, but if you want to see the exact commit you can find it [here - REMEMBER TO ADD LINK](https://github.com/ianw3214/HeavensEdge/commit/d5d11c53518c0ce20330a886f3972d5a2e1951cf)

## Option Overlay Tweening

Eventually I would have to get a separate menu for the options when it is presses, so I thought I might as well start it today. Of course, just having a menu pop up is quite unnatural, so I made a tweening menu that pops up above the original menu. I tried it first with velocity and acceleration, but that quickly got out of hand and I thought that there had to be a better way to do it.

Then, I thought I could do this mathematically, particularly with the formula *1/x* because it is a smooth curve that could simulate the menu transition. So I got to work and figure out how to implement it in the code. I'll show the code first then try to explain it:
```c++
// settings option for the select function
if (currentMenuItem->ID == 2) {
	// start the tween
	optionOverlayTweening = true;
	onOptions = true;
	overlayVerticalPosition = UTIL::getWindowHeight();
	tweenStartTime = SDL_GetTicks();
	optionOverlay = new Sprite(SPRITE_ID::OPTION_OVERLAY, 0, overlayVerticalPosition, UTIL::getWindowWidth(), UTIL::getWindowHeight());
}
```
I have to keep track of when the tween started to calculate projected position later on. Also, I set the width and height of the overlay sprite again in case the window size changes. The starting position of the sprite, represented by *overlayVerticalPosition*, is set to be at the bottom of the screen out of sight at first. Now, here is the new menu update function:
```c++
void Menu::update(float delta) {
	// update the tween if the sprite is still tweening
	if (optionOverlayTweening) {
		// get the difference in time from the start of the tween to now
		float timeStamp = static_cast<float>(SDL_GetTicks() - tweenStartTime);
		// if the time is over the desired tween time, set the sprite to position 0 and turn flag off
		if (timeStamp >= TWEEN_TIME) {
			overlayVerticalPosition = 0;
			optionOverlayTweening = false;
		}
		// otherwise, update the tween based on the time
		else if (timeStamp != 0) {
			// get the desired function input between 0.5 and 2
			float functionInput = (timeStamp / TWEEN_TIME) * 1.5 + 0.5;
			// plug the input into the function to get a number between 0 and 1
			float functionOutput = ((1 / functionInput) - 0.5) / 1.5;
			// use the resulting number to calculate the position of the option overlay
			overlayVerticalPosition = functionOutput * UTIL::getWindowHeight();
		}
		// set the position of the sprite
		optionOverlay->setPos(0, overlayVerticalPosition);
	}
}
```
Most of the code is explained by comments, but I'll quickly go over it again. Essentially, I am just finding a function input based on the time. I am using the function *1/x*, and I only want to use the domain of the function where *x > 0.5* and *x <= 2*, so I calculate an input with that specification. Then, the function will output with a range of *y >= 0.5* and *y < 2*. I can then modify the function output to be a number between 0 and 1 and that number will represent where on the screen the sprite should be if the top was 0 and the bottom was 1. Lastly, I simply update the new sprite to take the position that I previously calculated and then I get a smooth tween! I still have to work on tweening out but that should be more or less the same process.

## Some Changes

I've been making a couple of changes to the game, but they're not too technically difficult so I'll just list them here and link to their commits:

  - [Settings text/Player combo animation effects](https://github.com/ianw3214/HeavensEdge/commit/e23aaba02c778b185a7a5154e02dda1d35e3294c)
  - [Hero shadow/Menu Tween formula adjustment/LevelEditor tile overlay/creature out of map check](https://github.com/ianw3214/HeavensEdge/commit/2d95c48db79183aff14c8b070138f970030c4453)

## Plans for the next week

I've been a bit stuck working on this game right now because there is so many things to do but I haven't really planned out how to tackle each thing. Because of that, I have decided to make a list of things I want to accomplish next week so that I have a clear plan to follow and not get lost on the way. The list includes:  
  - functional settings menu
    - ~~Mute function~~
	- ~~Window size~~
	- ~~Fullscreen~~
	- fluid menu movement
  - Player death
    - death menu
    - ~~game restart~~
	- death animations
  - First level prototype
    - ~~Level concepts~~
	- Tile sets
	- Enemy AI
	- Enemy assets
  - Player sprites
    - Combo attack
	- Combo effect

As you can see, I have my work cut out for me next week and hopefully by the end I'll have everything done.

First, I finished the functionalities of the settings menu, see the commit [here](https://github.com/ianw3214/HeavensEdge/commit/5d92ab9374246b3c6f4262296be6fb3aa51dd652).
Then, I added a death menu for when the player dies and implemented the functionalites for the menu, see the commit [here](https://github.com/ianw3214/HeavensEdge/commit/4b748a10842b257db2d98e747b0036ab6d7e366c). After that, I designed some level concepts which you can't see here because I drew it on paper. However, I also added some enemy sprite placeholders and added in directional animations for the basic enemy too. You can see the commit [here](https://github.com/ianw3214/HeavensEdge/commit/4a33ed5e91560919bbb86e4658cd1b2315e0183f). Also I'll show you some concept art I drew because why not!  
![concept art](pics/level1.png)

It's been a few days since I've worked on the game because hey, it's the summer :P Anyways, I worked on the enemy animations a bit and tweaked the level editor too, but mainly I was just working on assets so there's not much coding done. [The commit](https://github.com/ianw3214/HeavensEdge/commit/a9b48e3195bc54a51755fc2893bb81b7ba74fa08). I've started making the tileset as well, which meant some more work needed to be done on the editor. I added a file loading function into the editor, which wasn't too hard since I had something to copy paste from, and then I added some basic charge enemy animations, all in [this commit - REMEMBER TO LINK].
